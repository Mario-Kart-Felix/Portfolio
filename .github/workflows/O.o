    Introduction

      Outlet Broadcasting, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation ("Outlet
    Broadcasting"), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Outlet Communications, Inc.,
    a Delaware corporation ("Outlet Communications").  The operations of Outlet
    Broadcasting, a television broadcasting company, consist of three owned
    television stations along with one television station operated under a local
    marketing agreement.  The owned stations include two NBC network-affiliated
    VHF television stations and one independent UHF television station.

      The two VHF television stations are WJAR(TV), based in Cranston, Rhode
    Island, which serves the Providence-New Bedford market area and WCMH(TV),
    which is located in Columbus, Ohio and serves that market.  The UHF
    television station is WNCN(TV) (formerly WYED-TV) which is located in
    Clayton, North Carolina and broadcasts in the Raleigh-Durham (Fayetteville,
    Goldsboro and Rocky Mount), North Carolina market area.  Outlet Broadcasting
    acquired WNCN(TV) on August 10, 1994.  As of January 11, 1995 WNCN(TV) began
    broadcasting programming provided by The WB Television Network.

      Since April 18, 1994, Outlet Broadcasting has also operated independent
    UHF television station WWHO(TV), Chillicothe, Ohio, under a local marketing
    agreement with that station's licensee.  Outlet Broadcasting serves as a
    broker for the sale of that station's advertising time and provides it with
    certain programming and operating capabilities.  In return, Outlet
    Broadcasting retains a substantial percentage of WWHO(TV)'s net operating
    income to the extent that it exceeds cumulative net operating losses.  This
    station, as of January 11, 1995, became an affiliate of The WB Television
    Network.

      Outlet Broadcasting also offers production services to advertisers and
    others on an occasional basis.  This activity does not generate significant
    revenues.

    Television

      Outlet Broadcasting's television broadcasting revenues are derived from
    regional and national spot advertising, from local advertising, and from
    network compensation.

      Advertising rates charged by a television station are based primarily upon
    the population and number of television sets in the area served by the
    station, as well as the station's ability to attract audiences as reflected
    in surveys made by the A.C. Nielsen Company ("Nielsen") of the number of
    sets tuned to the station at various times.  Nielsen measures ratings within
    specific geographic markets by dividing the nation into Designated Market
    Areas ("DMA").

                                     - 2 -

      Advertising rates are highest during the most desirable viewing hours,
    with corresponding reductions during other hours.  The rates for national
    spot and local advertising are determined by each station.  Katz
    Communications, Inc. is Outlet Broadcasting's national sales representative
    firm.  Local advertising time is sold by each station's own sales force.

      Effective September 1, 1994, Outlet Broadcasting and NBC reached an
    understanding whereby Outlet Broadcasting's VHF television stations will
    retain their NBC network affiliations for a period of six years.  The
    affiliations give Outlet Broadcasting's VHF television stations the right to
    rebroadcast all programs transmitted by the NBC network.  For each hour of
    programming that is rebroadcast by the affiliate, the network pays the
    affiliate a fee, which varies in amount depending on the time of day during
    which the program is broadcast.  Although the hourly rates of network
    compensation are fixed, the total amount of network compensation received by
    each affiliated station is subject to the number of network program hours
    rebroadcast by that station.

      Network programs are produced either by the networks themselves or by
    independent production companies and are primarily transmitted via satellite
    by the network to its affiliated stations for rebroadcast.  Each of Outlet
    Broadcasting's television stations also acquires programs from non-network
    sources and produces its own programs for broadcast.
 
      Approximately 62% of the television programming aired on Outlet
    Broadcasting's Cranston station is provided by NBC and approximately 25% is
    provided or licensed by independent third parties.  Outlet Broadcasting's
    Columbus station receives 52% of its programming from NBC and 34% is
    provided or licensed by independent third parties.  The remaining portion of
    Outlet Broadcasting's VHF television station programming consists
    principally of local programs, such as news, public affairs and children's
    programs, produced by the individual television stations.

      Another factor affecting television revenues is the increase in straight
    barter and cash-plus-barter arrangements.  Under such arrangements national
    program distributors retain up to 50% of advertising time available, which
    would otherwise be available for sale by the stations to national
    advertisers.  While these arrangements reduce the cost of new programming
    because the value of the advertising time withheld is credited against its
    cost, they also result in decreased revenues to stations and introduce new
    competitors to the advertising market.


                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>
 
      The principal portion of Outlet Broadcasting's UHF television station
    programming consists of syndicated shows, children's programs, movies and,
    at WWHO(TV), news.  Outlet Broadcasting has also entered into an agreement
    with The WB Television Network ("WB") for WB to provide network programming
    to WWHO(TV).  Commencing in January 1995, WB will provide one night of prime
    time programming for two hours.  A second night of prime-time programming is
    scheduled to commence during the third quarter of 1995 along with selected
    children's programming.  Additional programming will thereafter be provided
    in accordance with a schedule of roll-out dates to the extent that WB makes
    available such programming for rebroadcast.  The initial period of the WB
    agreement is for three years and may be extended for additional successive
    periods of two years each if agreed upon by the parties.

      WNCN(TV) is currently broadcasting WB programming on a temporary basis.
    As of October 1, 1995, WNCN(TV) is scheduled to become an NBC network
    affiliate.

      In order to compensate WB for its programming, Outlet Broadcasting will
    pay WB an annual payment based on Outlet Broadcasting's WB affiliated
    station television market ratings for prime time broadcast periods of WB
    programming.  The payments are based on the value and/or profitability added
    to each station as a result of its affiliation with WB and to pay to WB 25%
    of such added value and/or profitability.

      The following is a description of each of the television stations operated
    by Outlet Broadcasting.

    WJAR(TV)

      WJAR(TV) is a VHF station affiliated with the NBC network.  It is located
    in Cranston, Rhode Island but serves the capital city of Providence, Rhode
    Island and broadcasts over Channel 10 in the Providence-New Bedford
    television market. This market is ranked 46th in the nation in terms of
    number of television households in its DMA.

    WCMH(TV)

      WCMH(TV) broadcasts over Channel 4 in Columbus, the capital city of Ohio,
    and is a VHF station affiliated with NBC.  The Columbus television market is
    ranked 34th in the country in its  DMA.

    WNCN(TV)

      WNCN(TV) is an independent UHF television station, located in Clayton,
    North Carolina, that serves the capital city of Raleigh, North Carolina.  It
    broadcasts over Channel 17 in the Raleigh-Durham (Fayetteville, Goldsboro
    and Rocky Mount) North Carolina television market, which is ranked 32nd in
    the nation in terms of number of television households in its DMA.  Since
    January 11, 1995, the station has broadcast programming provided by WB.

    WWHO(TV)

      WWHO(TV) is an independent UHF television station that became affiliated
    with The WB Television Network as of January 11, 1995.  It is located in
    Chillicothe, Ohio but serves the capital city of Columbus, Ohio and
    broadcasts over Channel 53 in the Columbus-Chillicothe television market
    area.

    Competition

      Outlet Broadcasting's television stations compete for revenues with other
    broadcasting stations in their respective markets, as well as with other
    advertising media, such as newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising,
    transit advertising, and direct mail.

      Competition in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual
    markets.  Generally, except as set forth below, a television broadcasting
    station in one market does not compete with stations in other market areas.
    Outlet Broadcasting television stations are located in highly competitive
    markets.

      Factors that are material to competitive positions include authorized
    power, assigned frequency, management experience, network affiliation,
    audience characteristics and local program acceptance, as well as strength
    of local competition.  The broadcasting industry is continuously faced with
    technological change and innovation, the possible rise of popularity of
    competing entertainment and communications media, changes in labor
    conditions, and governmental restrictions or actions of federal regulatory
    bodies, including the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC").  Any of
    such developments could possibly have a material effect on Outlet
    Broadcasting's operations and profits.

      Under present FCC regulations, no additional conventional, full power, VHF
    or UHF commercial television stations may be constructed or operated in any
    of the markets where Outlet Broadcasting's television stations are located
    except there is a construction permit for WFDG-TV, Channel 28, New Bedford,
    Massachusetts in the Providence market.

      There are sources of video programming other than conventional television
    stations, the most common being cable television ("CATV").  These other
    sources have increased the competition for broadcasting stations by bringing
    into their markets distant broadcasting signals not otherwise available to
    the stations' audience and also serving as a distribution system for
    programs originating on the cable system.  Programming is now being
    distributed to CATVs by both terrestrial microwave systems and by satellite.
    The FCC has also authorized intermediate carriers to pick up the signals of
    so-called "superstations" and to deliver them to CATV systems via satellite,
    including CATV systems in each of Outlet Broadcasting's television markets.


                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>
 
      The Signal Carriage Provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection
    and Competition Act of 1992 require CATV system operators, under most
    conditions, to transmit the broadcast signal of local commercial television
    stations.  In certain circumstances, the CATV operator is prohibited from
    carrying broadcast stations without obtaining the stations' consent.  Once
    every three years a television broadcaster must choose whether to proceed
    under its must carry, but uncompensated, alternative or instead negotiate a
    grant of retransmission consent permitting the CATV operator to carry the
    station's signal in exchange for consideration from the CATV operator.
    Because Outlet Broadcasting's television stations enjoy significant
    viewership, the stations are carried by most of the cable television systems
    serving their market area.  In this regard, the VHF stations have,
    primarily, granted retransmission consent to their cable operators and in
    return have obtained, in certain instances, the right to produce news
    programs which will be carried by available channels on such cable systems.
    The UHF stations have generally proceeded with cable system operators under
    the must carry alternative.

      Other sources of competition include subscription television ("STV"), pay
    cable, multi-point distribution systems and multichannel multi-point
    distribution systems, satellite-fed master antenna systems and home
    entertainment systems (including television game devices, video cassette
    recorder and playback systems, and video discs).  Outlet Broadcasting's
    television stations also face competition from Direct Broadcast Satellites
    ("DBS"), which transmit programming directly to homes equipped with special
    receiving antennas or to CATV systems for transmission to their subscribers.
    See "Business--Federal Regulation of Broadcasting" for possible additional
    competitive impact from proposed technological changes.

    Strategy

      Despite the changing dynamics of the television industry, management
    believes that there will continue to be opportunities to generate
    significant revenues from mass marketed programming and associated
    advertising.  Management believes that an increasing number of national
    "niche" cable channels will continue to fractionalize video viewing,
    including the cable networks themselves, and that these channels may find it
    difficult to attract enough viewers to generate significant advertiser
    support or obtain satisfactory programming on a cost-effective basis.
    However, management believes that Outlet Broadcasting's blend of strong
    local news programming, combined with national network programming and
    selective use of syndicated programming at its VHF television stations, will
    continue to attract large viewing audiences and advertiser support.
    Additionally, management believes that the syndicated programs, movies and
    children's programs offered by Outlet Broadcasting's UHF television stations
    provide an attractive alternative to the more traditional news and network-
    provided programming.


                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>
 
      Successful programming of broadcast television requires constant
    refinement, on the basis of cost effectiveness, of the match between
    available programming and the changing tastes of the local viewing audience.
    In  conjunction with its strategy to reduce overall costs and increase
    profitability, Outlet Broadcasting has directed the programming focus at its
    VHF television stations towards building on local news leadership and
    selectively reducing purchases of syndicated programs.  At its UHF stations,
    however, Outlet Broadcasting has engaged in network affiliations, as
    available, while simultaneously developing local news programming and
    improving its offerings of syndicated and children's programs.  Outlet
    Broadcasting intends to continuously refine its programming mix in order to
    attract and hold the audiences desired by advertisers and to increase
    profitability.  Outlet Broadcasting also believes that its improving
    financial condition will enable it to consider the acquisition of desirable
    broadcast or related properties, should such properties become available.
    Outlet Broadcasting's strategy has the following elements:



              Build on Local News Leadership.  Local news programming is
              commercially valuable because of its high viewership level, the
              attractiveness to advertisers of the demographic characteristics
              of the typical news audience (allowing stations to charge higher
              rates for advertising time) and the enhanced ratings of other
              programming in time periods following the news.  In addition,
              strong local news product helps differentiate local broadcast
              stations from cable system competitors, which generally do not
              provide this service.  The cost of producing local news
              programming is generally lower than other sources of non-network
              programming, and the amount of local news programming can be
              increased for very modest incremental increases in cost.
              Moreover, such programming can be increased or decreased on very
              short notice, providing Outlet Broadcasting with greater
              programming flexibility.  Outlet Broadcasting has focused on
              maintaining and building each VHF station's local news franchise
              as the foundation of its strategy to maintain and build audience
              loyalty and increase revenues and profitability.  According to the
              November 1994 Nielsen report, WJAR(TV) remained as the leading
              news station in its market while WCMH (TV)'s weekday news programs
              generally captured the second largest share of the Columbus
              audience in their time periods.  WWHO(TV) has instituted a one-
              hour 10:00 p.m. news program and WNCN(TV) is in process of
              installing a news department to prepare to provide local news
              programming during the latter half of 1995.


                                     - 7 -

              Optimize Selection of Syndicated Programming.  At its VHF
              television stations, Outlet Broadcasting has operated to reduce
              its dependence on, and financial commitment to, syndicated
              programming.  Within this framework, Outlet Broadcasting has
              balanced the cost of available syndicated programs with their
              potential to increase advertising revenue, while giving due
              consideration to the risk of reduced popularity during the term of
              the program contract.  Outlet Broadcasting is now selectively
              buying only those programs which are available on a cost-effective
              basis and for contractual periods which permit financial and
              programming flexibility.  Selected programs must also complement a
              station's overall and/or competitive programming strategies.

              Outlet Broadcasting's UHF television stations are more dependent
              on syndicated programs for their overall programming needs.  At
              these stations, Outlet Broadcasting has sought to upgrade the
              quality of their syndicated programs, on a cost-effective basis,
              in order to provide a more attractive product to their viewers.

              Strengthen Advertiser Relationships.  Advertising by political
              candidates injects significant revenues in relatively short time
              periods, but disrupts traditional commercial advertising.  In
              conjunction with a policy decision not to accept advertising by
              political candidates during local news programs, Outlet
              Broadcasting effectively limited the amount of such advertising
              its stations will carry, thereby minimizing the disruption to
              commercial advertisers.  Outlet Broadcasting also improved its
              audience research capability and enlarged the production
              facilities available to its advertisers.  In addition, Outlet
              Broadcasting expanded its sales staff devoted to supporting its
              advertising customers.  Management believes that these actions
              will strengthen Outlet Broadcasting's relations with these
              customers.

              Control Costs.  Management believes that controlling costs is
              essential to achieving and maintaining the profitability of its
              broadcast television stations.  Therefore, Outlet Broadcasting
              implemented a program to control costs which, beginning in 1992,
              led to substantially improved operating results.  The cost control
              measures included reducing financial commitments to costly, long-
              term syndicated program contracts, increasing the amount of local
              news programming, reducing staff and corporate overhead and
              relocating WJAR(TV) and corporate headquarters to a more efficient
              facility.  Through its ongoing strategic planning and annual
              budget processes, Outlet Broadcasting intends to continue to
              identify and implement cost saving opportunities.

    Seasonality

      Outlet Broadcasting's operating revenues are generally highest in the
    second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in
    beverage advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period
    leading up to and including the holiday season.  Revenues may also be
    affected by special events carried by NBC, such as the Olympic Games or the
    Super Bowl.  In addition, advertising revenues are generally higher during
    political election years due to campaign spending by political candidates.

    Other Activities

      In addition to its broadcasting properties, Outlet Broadcasting has
    interests in certain television production activities.  These activities now
    only include the offering by each of Outlet Broadcasting's television
    stations of production services to advertisers and others.  It is not
    anticipated that any of such activities will generate significant revenues.

    Exploration of Strategic Alternatives

      On March 21, 1995, Outlet Communications announced that the  Board of
    Directors had retained a financial advisor to help Outlet Communications
    explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a
    possible business combination, the sale of all or a portion of Outlet
    Communications, potential acquisitions or any other similar transactions.
    Outlet Communications said that there can be no assurance that any
    transaction will result from the exploration process.

    Federal Regulation of Broadcasting

      Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under
    the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act").  The
    Communications Act prohibits television broadcasting except in accordance
    with a license issued by the FCC.  The Communications Act also empowers the
    FCC, among other things, to issue, revoke or modify broadcasting licenses,
    to determine the location of stations, to regulate the equipment used by
    stations, to adopt such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the
    provisions of the Communications Act, and to impose penalties for violation
    of such regulations.  The assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer
    of control of a corporation holding a license cannot be effected without the
    prior approval of the FCC.

      Television licenses are issued for terms of five years.  Licenses are
    renewable for additional terms upon application to the FCC, which will
    approve the renewal without a hearing if there are no conflicting
    applications or petitions to deny by third parties conflicting with the
    renewal applications (either of which could require a hearing), or adverse
    findings as to the licensee's qualifications.  In recent years, there have
    been a number of challenges and competing applications to broadcast license
    renewal applications although, in the vast majority of cases, television
    licenses are renewed by the FCC.

      The FCC rules permit cognizable ownership by one entity of up to twelve
    television stations, up to eighteen FM radio stations and up to eighteen AM
    radio stations.  With respect to television stations, however, the FCC
    adopted an additional ownership limit based on audience reach.  Under the
    audience-reach limitation, an entity may acquire cognizable ownership
    interests in up to twelve television stations only if the aggregate number
    of television households reached by the television stations does not exceed
    25% of the national television household audience as determined by  market
    ratings.  The percentage of the national television household audience
    reached by the television stations owned by Outlet Broadcasting is
    significantly below these limitations.

      The FCC rules also generally prohibit the common ownership of a television
    station and either an AM or an FM radio station with overlapping areas of
    local service, although an AM-FM station combination by itself is permitted.
    Ownership of a newspaper, CATV system, and a television station in the same
    market is also prohibited.  These rules apply only to those who seek new
    authorizations or FCC approval of transfers of existing combinations.

      The FCC requires the attribution of the licenses held by a broadcasting
    company to its officers, directors, and certain holders of its voting
    securities, so that there would be a violation of FCC regulations where an
    officer, director, or stockholder and a broadcasting company together hold
    more than the permitted number of stations or own stations that serve the
    same area.

      The foregoing is only a brief summary of certain provisions of the
    Communications Act and the regulations of the FCC.  Reference is made to the
    Communications Act, FCC regulations and the public notices promulgated by
    the FCC for further information.  Outlet Broadcasting is unable to predict
    what impact, if any, changes in these laws would have.

    Music Licensing

      In 1983, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
    upheld a challenge by members of the television industry to the legality,
    under the antitrust laws, of the so-called "blanket" music-licensing system
    routinely used by the ASCAP and BMI music-licensing organizations in
    authorizing broadcasters to use copyrighted musical works in syndicated
    television programming.  The District Court established an interim blanket
    license rate frozen at the level in effect in 1980.  This interim

                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>
 
    rate was set to permit the licensing organizations to collect some revenue
    pending final court determination of the case, with the understanding that
    television stations would be liable for any retroactive rate increases set
    by the court.  However, the judgment of the District Court was reversed by
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Subsequently, the U.S.
    Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case, thereby affirming the
    Second Circuit's determination that blanket music licensing is permissible.
    A final determination of retroactive adjustments in music-licensing rates
    for the interim time period remained pending.

      On February 26, 1993, the District Court ruled that broadcasters may pay
    music license fees on either a per program basis or a blanket license based
    on a flat fee (ASCAP had sought a blanket license based on a percentage of
    each station's revenue).  In addition, the District Court established a
    formula for determining industry-wide license payments for the retroactive
    period to 1983. The District Court also instructed the parties to develop a
    formula to govern the allocation of annual blanket license fees among
    television stations.

      In September 1993 the members of the television industry and ASCAP reached
    final agreement on television music performance rights fees payable by
    television stations through 1994.  The agreement provides for continuation
    of the interim blanket and per program licenses and payments through the end
    of 1994.  The parties also agreed that ASCAP receive an additional industry-
    wide payment of $4 million for 1993 and an additional $10.65 million to be
    paid in 1994.  (The 1993 and 1994 add-on payments allocated to WJAR(TV) and
    WCMH(TV) amounted to approximately $60,000 in the aggregate).

      ASCAP has appealed the rate court decision establishing  blanket and per
    program license fees effective January 1, 1995.   Pending resolution of the
    appeal, ASCAP and a committee representing the television industry have
    agreed that television stations will continue to pay ASCAP for the period
    January 1, 1995 through June 30, 1995 on the same basis as the stations were
    currently reporting and paying.  The parties have also agreed that ASCAP
    receive an additional industry-wide payment for the six month period of
    $3.064 million.  This amount will be allocated to individual stations by
    formula.  It is expected that the allocation to Outlet Broadcasting's
    television stations will be relatively minor.

      In March 1994 a committee representing members of the television industry
    announced that a final agreement had been reached with BMI, whose music
    licensing fees are generally tied to ASCAP fees.  The agreement provided for
    continuation of the interim blanket and per program licenses and payments to
    BMI through the end of 1994.  The agreement also called for an additional,
    industry-wide payment of $14 million to be made during the balance of 1994
    ($6.125 payable by May 20, 1994 and the remaining $7.875 payable at $1.125
    million each month June through


                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>
 
    December, 1994).  The add-on payments were allocated to each television
    station in accordance with the formula developed for the previous ASCAP
    settlement allocation.

      BMI currently receives approximately 70% of what ASCAP receives.  However,
    BMI is continuing to advocate that it should be paid on parity with ASCAP.
    As a result, BMI and the committee representing the television industry are
    continuing to negotiate fee determinations.  The final fee determinations,
    as noted above, could have an effect on Outlet Broadcasting's continuing
    costs of music licensing for its television properties.

    Employee Relations

      Outlet Communications and Outlet Broadcasting have approximately 325 full-
    time employees.  Approximately 172 of such employees are represented by
    labor unions under collective bargaining agreements.  These agreements
    expire on various dates through February 1997.  Outlet Broadcasting
    contributes to and maintains employee benefit and retirement plans for its
    employees.

             ------------------------------------

    Results of Operations
    ---------------------

        Outlet Broadcasting's operations consist of three owned television
    stations and one television station operated under a local marketing
    agreement.  The owned stations include two NBC network-affiliated VHF
    television stations and one independent UHF television station.

        The two VHF television stations are WJAR-TV, which serves the
    Providence, Rhode Island-New Bedford, Massachusetts area and WCMH-TV, which
    serves the Columbus, Ohio area.  The UHF television station, acquired by
    Outlet Broadcasting on August 10, 1994, is WNCN-TV (formerly WYED-TV) which
    serves the Raleigh-Durham (Fayetteville, Goldsboro and Rocky Mount), North
    Carolina market area.

        Since April 18, 1994, Outlet Broadcasting has also operated independent
    UHF television station WWHO-TV, Chillicothe, Ohio, under a local marketing
    agreement with that station's licensee.  Outlet Broadcasting serves as a
    broker for the sale of that station's advertising time and provides it with
    certain programming and operating capabilities.  In return, Outlet
    Broadcasting retains a substantial percentage of WWHO-TV's net operating
    income to the extent that it exceeds net operating losses.

          The following table summarizes Outlet Broadcasting's operating results
    for the last three years and shows rates of change applicable thereto.  The
    table also shows the amounts of revenue obtained from both non-political and
    political revenue sources.

    Revenues


      In 1994, total net revenue of $59,442,000 increased by $12,490,000 or
    26.6% compared with $46,952,000 in 1993.  Of the 1994 revenue total, non-
    political revenue amounted to $55,696,000.  This was an increase of
    $8,961,000 or 19.2% compared with $46,735,000 in the prior year.  Recent
    station additions, WWHO-TV and WNCN-TV, added marginally to the revenue
    gain.  Their aggregate revenue amounted to less than 4% of the prior year's
    revenue total.

      The increase in non-political revenue was primarily attributable to
    overall improvement in economic conditions, a strong demand for advertising
    time and favorable viewership of Outlet Broadcasting's VHF television
    stations.  This allowed advertising rates to continue to trend higher.
    Increases occurred in both national spot and local time sales.  There was
    also an increase of more than 16% in network compensation.  This was a
    favorable result of the terms of Outlet Broadcasting's renewed affiliation
    with the NBC network which became effective September 1, 1994.

      Advertiser spending for political campaigns was significant in the 1994
    election year and political revenue totalled $3,746,000.  This amount
    comprised 6.3% of total revenue in 1994, whereas in 1992, political
    advertising of $1,514,000 comprised 3.4% of the revenue total.

      Both of Outlet Broadcasting's VHF television stations had increases in
    total revenue.  For the third consecutive year, WCMH-TV established a record
    high in station revenue.  WCMH-TV increased its non-political local and
    national spot revenue for the year by approximately 11.4%.  Political
    advertising provided a further 4.6% increase to the station's revenues.  The
    increased revenue reflected an estimated 15% growth in the Columbus
    advertising market.

      WJAR-TV increased its non-political local and national spot revenue for
    the year by approximately 20.6% with political advertising providing a
    further increase to the station's revenue of 12.4%.  The increased revenue
    reflected an estimated 17% growth in the Providence advertising market.
    Thus, WJAR-TV was able to increase its market share from that of 1993.

      In 1993, total net revenue of $46,952,000 increased by $1,799,000 or 4%
    compared to $45,153,000 in 1992.  Of the 1993 revenue total, non-political
    revenue amounted to $46,735,000.  This was an increase of $3,096,000 or 7.1%
    compared to $43,639,000 in the prior year.  Since 1993 was not a traditional
    election year, advertiser spending for political campaigns was minimal and
    net political revenue declined to $217,000.



                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>
 
      Revenues were favorably affected in 1993 by a rebounding economy along
    with strong viewer ratings at Outlet Broadcasting's television stations.
    This allowed advertising rates to trend generally higher.  The increase in
    non-political revenue occurred notwithstanding that 1992 had approximately
    $2,000,000 in added revenues associated with that year's Summer Olympics.
    Total network compensation in 1993 remained approximately even with that of
    the prior year.

      In 1993, total revenue increased at both of Outlet Broadcasting's
    television stations.  Increased revenue at WCMH-TV reflected continued
    growth in the Columbus advertising market.  Exclusive of political
    advertising, local revenue at WCMH-TV was up by more than 13%.

      Non-political local and national revenue in the Providence market, during
    1993, remained approximately even with the prior year.  Nevertheless, WJAR-
    TV increased its local and national spot revenues for the year by
    approximately 8%.  Thus, the station was able to increase its market share
    from that of 1992.

      In order to reduce dependency on an inconsistent revenue source, as of the
    1992 election year Outlet Broadcasting began limiting the advertising spots
    available to political candidates on its television stations.  As part of
    this strategy, Outlet Broadcasting opted not to offer political advertising
    spots during its local news programs.  This allowed Outlet Broadcasting to
    better serve its regular local and national advertisers by providing them
    advertising time that is not always available, during election years, at
    competing television stations.  Compared to prior election years, political
    revenue in 1992 declined at both television stations.  However, the amount
    of political revenue in the 1994 election year rebounded substantially.

    Operating Expenses

      Operating expenses in 1994 totalled $39,267,000.  This was an increase of
    $4,743,000 or 13.7% compared with $34,524,000 in 1993.  More than two-thirds
    of the total increase resulted from inclusion of operating expenses for
    WNCN-TV and WWHO-TV in 1994.  Excluding the effect of these added stations,
    there was a moderate 4% increase in total operating expenses.  In 1993,
    total operating expenses of $34,524,000 decreased by $332,000 or 1% compared
    to $34,856,000 in 1992.  As a percent to revenue, total expenses decreased
    from 77.2% in 1992 to 73.5% in 1993 and to 66.1% in 1994.

      Technical, programming and news expenses in 1994 of $20,113,000 increased
    by $2,078,000 or 11.5% compared with $18,035,000 in 1993.  Virtually all of
    the increase was accounted for by the added stations.  In 1993, technical,
    programming and news expenses decreased by $674,000 or 3.6% from $18,709,000
    in the prior year.

                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>
 
      Programming expenses include departmental operating costs as well as
    charges for amortization of film contract rights.  Since 1992 Outlet
    Broadcasting has strategically reduced its annual costs for amortization of
    film contracts.  This was done by selectively replacing more costly programs
    with increased local programming, particularly news, or by replacing such
    costly programs with more popular and/or cost-effective programs.  As a
    result, programming expense at Outlet Broadcasting's VHF television stations
    decreased by approximately 2% and 15% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      During 1994, 1993 and 1992, Outlet Broadcasting recorded lump sum charges
    of $598,000, $358,000 and $457,000, respectively, representing valuation
    write-downs of certain film contracts.  The 1994 and 1993 charges primarily
    apply to "Who's the Boss" and the 1992 charge applies to "The Cosby Show",
    licensed to WCMH-TV.  The show is no longer an important producer of
    revenue.

      As a result of Outlet Broadcasting's increased production of local news
    programs, total news department expenses at the VHF stations increased by
    approximately 6% in 1994 after having increased by more than 4% in 1993.
    Outlet Broadcasting believes that increasing its commitment to local
    programs, while at the same time reducing its reliance on, and the term of,
    purchased programming, will help increase its market share and improve
    programming as well as provide cost flexibility.

      Selling, general and administrative expenses of $13,774,000 in 1994
    increased by $2,133,000 or 18.3% compared with $11,641,000 in 1993.  The
    addition of television stations WNCN-TV and WWHO-TV accounted for
    approximately two-thirds of the total increase.  The balance of the increase
    primarily reflected higher sales commissions and incentive awards payable
    because of Outlet Broadcasting's improved operating performance.  In 1993,
    selling, general and administrative expenses of $11,641,000 increased by
    $482,000 or 4.3% compared with $11,159,000 in the prior year.  The amount
    for 1993 included added costs for employee benefits and uncollectible
    customer accounts.  As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and
    administrative expenses declined to 23.2% in 1994 from approximately 24.7%
    in each of the prior two years.

      Depreciation expense and amortization of intangibles both increased in
    1994 due to Outlet Broadcasting's recent investments in WNCN-TV and WWHO-TV.
    Depreciation expense decreased in 1993 as certain asset values became fully
    depreciated.

      The favorable effect of increased revenue and controlled operating
    expenses, in each of the last two years, provided a significant improvement
    to operating income.  In 1994, operating income of $20,175,000 increased by
    $7,747,000 or 62.3% when

                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>
 
    compared with operating income of $12,428,000 in 1993.  This improvement
    reflected a 26.6% increase in revenue reduced by a 13.7% increase in total
    expenses.  In 1993, operating income of $12,428,000 increased by $2,131,000
    or 20.7% compared with $10,297,000 in 1992.  As a percent of revenue, the
    operating income for 1994 was 33.9% and exceeded the operating margins of
    26.5% and 22.8% for 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Interest Expense

      The following table summarizes interest expense for the last three years.

</TABLE>
    (a) Net of capitalized interest of $225,000.


         Total interest expense decreased in each of the last two years due to
    (a) reductions made to outstanding debt over the same time period, and (b) a
    1993 refinancing of Outlet Broadcasting's total debt with borrowings at a
    lower rate of interest.  Details of the 1993 refinancing are provided in the
    discussion on net cash used by financing activities within this report.

         Debt reductions included, in 1992, Outlet Broadcasting's repayment of
    the outstanding balance of a former senior bank loan in the principal amount
    of $3.3 million and open market purchases of its 13 1/4% Senior Subordinated
    Notes (the "Senior Notes") in the amount of $6.8 million.  Outlet
    Broadcasting also paid off its outstanding mortgage debt of $2.8 million, in
    1992, from the proceeds of a sale of real estate.

         Interest expense on the note to shareholder represents the annual
    accretion on the Junior Subordinated Note (the "Junior Note") payable to The
    Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company at its effective interest rate of
    17.2%.  Commencing in 1992, the terms of the debt instrument required an
    annual cash interest payment of $6,250,000 based on a principal amount of
    $50,000,000 and an annual interest rate of 12 1/2%.

    Other Income (Expense) Items

         Interest income principally represents earnings on invested cash.
    Interest income declined in 1994 and 1993 due to lower average cash balances
    and/or lower market interest rates.  In 1992, interest income also included
    interest received on tax refunds.  In 1994 and 1992, other income
    principally represents tower rental income and other miscellaneous items.
    In 1993, other income principally represents a reversed accrual which
    provided for Outlet Broadcasting's potential exposure in a music licensing
    dispute that was settled that year.

         Other expense in 1994 included approximately $260,000 as the cost of
    employee stock options.  Other expense in 1993 and 1992 included write-downs
    of $117,000 and $165,000, respectively, attributable to an investment in a
    television series, "Hennesey," which Outlet Broadcasting acquired pursuant
    to a shared distribution venture.  Outlet Broadcasting has attempted to
    license the black and white television series to other broadcasters but has
    not been successful in doing so.

         In April 1993 Outlet Broadcasting moved corporate headquarters and
    WJAR-TV to a newly acquired and renovated facility, located in Cranston,
    Rhode Island, after having sold its former Providence facility in 1992.  The
    1992 sale of real estate resulted in a nonrecurring gain of $1,401,000.

         The 1994, 1993 and 1992 income tax expenses of $660,000, $316,000 and
    $128,000, respectively, represent the applicable current year's provision
    for taxes.  The 1994 provision for income taxes was reduced as the result of
    an adjustment of prior year net operating losses.  See Note 4 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

         In 1993, an extraordinary loss of $1,826,000 or ($1.83) per share, net
    of taxes, represented one-time debt extinguishment costs resulting from a
    debt refinancing.  See Notes 5 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

         Effective January 1, 1993, Outlet Broadcasting adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
    Taxes", which requires a change to the liability method of accounting for
    deferred income taxes.  Adoption of Statement 109 resulted in a cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle, in the amount of $4,434,000 or
    $4.43 per share, representing the recognition of previously unrecognized tax
    benefits.

         Outlet Broadcasting also adopted, as of January 1, 1993, FASB Statement
    No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
    Pensions."  See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The effect
    of adoption of Statement 106 was not material.

                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>
 
         Outlet Broadcasting had net income for 1994 of $10,569,000 or $1.61 per
    share.  This compares with income before extraordinary loss and cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle, in 1993, of $2,026,000 or $.31 per
    share.  After giving effect to the extraordinary loss and change in
    accounting principle, net income for 1993 amounted to $4,634,000 or $.71 per
    share.  In 1992 there was a net loss of $1,552,000 or ($.24) per share.

    Liquidity and Capital Resources

         In 1994, net cash provided by operations totalled $19,466,000.  This
    was an increase of $15,594,000 or 402.7% compared to $3,872,000 in 1993.  In
    1993, there was an improvement of $228,000 in net cash provided by
    operations compared to 1992.  The positive trend in net cash from operations
    reflects the improved operating results described in "Results of
    Operations."  In addition, net cash from operations in 1994 reflects a one-
    time payment of $5,000,000 received from NBC upon renewal of Outlet
    Broadcasting's affiliation with that network.  This amount has been reported
    as deferred revenue and will be amortized into revenue over the six year
    duration of the affiliation. The amount of deferred revenue to be amortized
    over the ensuing period of twelve months is included in current liabilities.

         The improved operating results also caused Outlet Broadcasting's
    operating cash flow to increase.  Operating cash flow of $25,555,000
    increased by $8,279,000 or 47.9% compared to $17,276,000 in 1993.  In 1992,
    operating cash flow amounted to $15,285,000.

         Over the last three years, Outlet Broadcasting's investment in film
    contract rights has been at a relatively stable but reduced level.  The
    annual increases in film contracts during 1994, 1993 and 1992 amounted to
    $4,149,000, $4,672,000 and $3,460,000, respectively.  The increase for 1994
    was partially attributable to WNCN-TV and WWHO-TV, the television stations
    added during the year.  Overall, the amounts invested in film contract
    rights have enabled Outlet Broadcasting to maintain attractive programs on a
    cost-effective basis.  The result has been successful in that audience
    levels have been retained, while investments in film contract rights have
    been reasonable and manageable.  In addition, since the number of viewing
    hours committed to news shows has been expanded, the demand for film
    acquisitions has been reduced.

         Although Outlet Broadcasting is strategically committed to a reduced
    investment in film contract rights, it has been selective in this process.
    At December 31, 1994 Outlet Broadcasting had commitments to acquire
    approximately $10,992,000 of film contract rights compared to commitments of
    $3,492,000 at December 31, 1993.  The increased commitment primarily
    reflects Outlet Broadcasting's extended association with the Oprah Winfrey
    Show, to the year 2000, in behalf of WJAR-TV.  It was considered that the
    total benefits to be derived from this program would provide a sound
    economic return to the broadcast station.

                                     - 21 -

         The net decreases in film contracts payable of $1,773,000, $409,000 and
    $2,497,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, reflect payments of film
    contract obligations in accordance with the contracted terms and in the
    normal course of business.  Along with the reduced investment in film
    contract rights, the payments contributed to the overall reduction in film
    contracts payable at December 31, 1994.

         Amortization of film contract rights reflect the normal write-off of
    film contract values over the period of their use.  The reported amounts for
    the years 1992 through 1994 have trended lower and also include the
    previously described lump-sum charges for valuation write-downs of certain
    film contracts.

         Cash interest payments for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $8,096,000,
    $13,071,000 (net of capitalized interest of $225,000) and $13,150,000,
    respectively.  The amount paid in 1994 includes interest of $1,571,000 on
    Outlet Broadcasting's senior bank loan and interest of $6,525,000 on the
    outstanding 10 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes.  The amount paid in 1993
    includes interest of $6,769,000 on loan and notes payable (primarily the
    Senior Notes), along with interest of $6,527,000 (two semi-annual
    installments of $3,125,000 each plus accrued interest through date of
    redemption) on the Junior Note.  Cash interest payments on the Junior Note
    commenced February 1, 1992 on a semi-annual basis.

         Interest payments in 1992 included interest on the Senior Notes along
    with interest on a senior loan and a mortgage loan.  In 1992 there were also
    cash interest payments required with respect to the Junior Note.  Interest
    payments also trended lower because of Outlet Broadcasting's 1992 purchase
    of Senior Notes in open market transactions  and because of repayments of
    its senior loan and mortgage loan, both of which were fully repaid in 1992.
    Accretion of debt discount of $649,000 and $1,059,000 in 1993 and 1992,
    respectively, represent interest accrued on the Junior Note in excess of the
    $6,250,000 payment, pursuant to the Junior Note's effective interest rate of
    17.2%.

         The increase in accounts receivable of $2,800,000 in 1994 primarily
    results from the year's increased volume of business and the effect of two
    added television stations.  The 1994 increase in accrued expenses primarily
    reflects employee related obligations, including those of the added
    television stations, and an increase in commissions payable to third
    parties.

         In 1994, net cash used by investing activities totalled  $9,932,000.
    This included capital expenditures, for all four television stations, of
    $3,385,000, and an investment of $1,055,000 pursuant to a local marketing
    agreement entered into with the licensee of WWHO-TV.  In addition, Outlet
    Broadcasting purchased the assets and broadcast license of WNCN-TV for an
    aggregate price of $5,478,000, including acquisition costs of approximately
    $105,000.

                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>
 
         In 1993, net cash used by investing activities of $5,907,000
    represented capital expenditures for, primarily, completion of renovations
    and improvements to Outlet Broadcasting's new corporate headquarters and
    WJAR-TV broadcast facility in Cranston, Rhode Island.  This amount also
    included costs for equipping such facility with studio and technical
    equipment.

         In 1992, net cash provided by investing activities amounted to
    $4,157,000.  This included proceeds of $7.1 million received from the sale
    of land and a building in Providence, Rhode Island.  In connection with the
    purchase and renovation of its new Cranston facility, as of December 31,
    1992 Outlet Broadcasting incurred costs for construction in progress
    totalling $2,062,000.  This principally represented the cost of land,
    building and partially completed improvements.  Outlet Broadcasting made
    additional capital expenditures in 1992 of $881,000, primarily for studio
    and technical equipment.

         Outlet Broadcasting's VHF television stations operate from modern
    studio facilities and do not require significant amounts of capital to be
    invested each year.  However, in order for the UHF television stations to
    maximize their operating potential, a considerable upgrading of the
    facilities and equipment utilized by these stations is required.  In order
    to accomplish this, from the total planned capital expenditures for 1995 of
    approximately $10,000,000 for all four television stations, approximately
    $7,200,000 will be allocated to the UHF stations.  Outlet Broadcasting
    anticipates that these capital expenditures can be financed from funds
    generated by internal operations.  Outlet Broadcasting's senior bank lender
    has agreed to waive any loan covenant restrictions that would otherwise have
    limited the amount of capital expenditures for the year.

         Net cash used by financing activities during 1994 amounted to
    $3,450,000.  This included payment of required quarterly installments
    totalling $3,500,000 due on a term loan with Outlet Broadcasting's senior
    bank lender.  Also in 1994, a capital contribution of $50,000 was provided
    to Outlet Broadcasting by its parent company.

         In 1993, net cash used by financing activities amounted to $10,416,000.
    During the year, Outlet Broadcasting undertook a refinancing of its total
    debt and thereby obtained benefits from lower interest rates and extended
    maturities on its subordinated borrowings along with improved financial
    flexibility.  Pursuant to the refinancing, on June 28, 1993 Outlet
    Broadcasting entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a bank (the
    "Senior Loan") under which the bank agreed to provide a secured senior
    credit facility consisting of a term loan in the principal amount of
    $25,000,000 and revolving loans in the maximum principal amount outstanding
    of $5,000,000.


                                     - 23 -

         On July 15, 1993 Outlet Broadcasting completed a public offering of
    10 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2003, in the principal amount of
    $60,000,000.  Proceeds of the public offering were used to prepay the
    principal balance of the Junior Note due 1997 at its carrying value of
    $43,946,000 plus accrued interest.

         Also, on August 17, 1993 Outlet Broadcasting redeemed in full its
    Senior Notes due 1997 in the principal amount of $44,150,000, at 105% of par
    plus accrued interest.  The premium payment on the redemption totalled
    $2,207,000.  Funds for the redemption included a balance remaining from the
    above public offering along with available cash and funds provided by the
    Senior Loan in the amount of $28,000,000.  The interest rates applicable to
    the public offering and the Senior Loan were less than the interest rates on
    the Senior Notes and the Junior Note, resulting in a decrease in 1993
    interest expense.

         During 1993, Outlet Broadcasting repaid $5,000,000, net, against its
    Senior Loan including term loan installments of $2,000,000.  Overall, there
    was a net decrease in long-term debt in 1993 of $4,447,000.

         Costs incurred in connection with the debt refinancing, $3,151,000,
    were capitalized to other assets.  On a pretax basis, debt extinguishment
    costs, comprised of the premium on debt refinancing - $2,207,000,
    unamortized note costs of the redeemed debt - $555,000, and other - $4,000,
    were reported as an extraordinary loss.  A capital contribution of $38,000
    was also provided to Outlet Broadcasting in 1993 by its parent company.

         In 1992, net cash used by financing activities totalled $12,994,000.
    This included a repayment of the outstanding balance of Outlet
    Broadcasting's former senior loan in the amount of $3,310,000 which matured
    on January 2, 1992.  Outlet Broadcasting also paid its outstanding mortgage
    loan in the amount of $2,859,000 upon sale of land and a building in
    Providence, Rhode Island in 1992.  In addition, Outlet Broadcasting
    purchased an aggregate $6,825,000 face amount of its outstanding Senior
    Notes in open-market transactions.

         At December 31, 1994 Outlet Broadcasting had net working capital, or an
    excess of current assets over current liabilities, in the amount of
    $2,575,000.  At December 31, 1993, there was an excess of current
    liabilities over current assets in the amount of $1,776,000.  The increase
    in working capital during 1994 was directly attributable to Outlet
    Broadcasting's improved results of operations.  In summary, Outlet
    Broadcasting's cash position increased by $6,084,000 during 1994.  This
    reflected funds provided by operations of $19,466,000 less aggregate funds
    used in

                                     - 24 -
<PAGE>
 
    investing and financing activities of $13,382,000.  In 1993, a net decrease
    of $12,451,000 in Outlet Broadcasting's cash position contributed to the
    year's overall decrease in net working capital.  The decrease primarily
    resulted from funds used for completion of the Cranston headquarters and
    broadcast studio along with funds used for debt reduction and debt
    refinancing.

         Under the provisions of its Senior Loan, Outlet Broadcasting has
    available to it a revolving credit facility in the amount of $5,000,000.
    Outlet Broadcasting expects that internally generated funds from operations
    and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will provide
    sufficient liquidity for Outlet Broadcasting to meet its ongoing operating
    and capital expenditure needs.

         In 1994, operating cash flow totalled $25,555,000 and the ratio of such
    amount to interest expense of $8,467,000 was 3.0 to 1.  In 1993, the ratio
    of operating cash flow of $17,276,000 to interest expense of $11,408,000 was
    1.5 to 1.

         It is expected that 1995 operations, along with current cash on hand,
    will provide sufficient funds to meet all cash requirements for that year,
    including debt service.  Outlet Broadcasting will continue to require
    substantial cash flow from operations in order to service its debt.  To the
    extent that funds are committed to debt service, they will not be available
    for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions or
    distributions to stockholders.

      Outlet Communications currently maintains the 1992 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the "Plan") as approved by stockholders on June 25, 1992, amended April 27,

    terms of options granted, the exercise price and exercisability thereof.

    Retirement Plans

      Outlet Broadcasting maintains a non-contributory qualified retirement plan
    (the "Retirement Plan") for the benefit of its employees, including the
    individuals named in the Summary Compensation Table.  As of August 31, 1994,
    Outlet Broadcasting curtailed the Retirement Plan and suspended the accrual
    of further benefits for all employees.  The following table shows the
    estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement to persons in specified

          The amounts payable shown in the preceding table are based on the
    following assumptions:  (i) the individual shall have retired at the normal
    retirement age of 65, (ii) "compensation" is the average of the covered
    compensation paid to such individual during the three calendar years in
    which salary is the highest, (iii) covered compensation is salary and
    bonuses paid to Plan participants, and for 1994 is shown in the Salary and
    Bonus columns of the Summary Compensation Table, and (iv) benefits are paid
    in the form of a straight-life annuity.

          In addition to the Retirement Plan, the individuals named in the
    Summary Compensation Table also participate in a non-qualified supplemental
    retirement plan (the "Supplemental Plan") which provides a supplemental
    benefit based on a percentage of final average compensation and years of
    service, less benefits paid under the Retirement Plan and Social Security
    benefits.  The following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable
    under the Supplemental Plan to persons in the specified salary and bonus

      On September 1, 1994 Outlet Broadcasting adopted the Outlet Broadcasting,
    Inc. 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan").  This plan is a
    qualified 401(k) deferred compensation plan whose purpose is to enable
    eligible employees to save for retirement.  Eligible employees are those
    employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless
    the agreement allows for participation in the 401(k) Plan, and who have
    completed one year of service and have attained age 21.

      Eligible employees may contribute up to the lesser of 15% of taxable
    compensation in each calendar year, excluding the taxable value of stock
    options, fringe benefits or moving and other expense reimbursements, or
    $9,240.  All employee contributions are allocated to the employee's
    individual account and, at the employee's election, are invested in money
    market, fixed income or equity funds.  Outlet Broadcasting will make
    matching contributions in an amount equal to 25% of the employee
    contributions but subject to a maximum employee contribution of 6% of
    eligible compensation.  Outlet Broadcasting's matching contributions vest
    with the employee at the rate of 20% for each year of service.  Outlet
    Broadcasting may also make annual discretionary profit sharing contributions
    in an amount to be determined by the Board of Directors at the end of each
    calendar year.  The maximum contributions allowed are limited by regulations
    promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code.


    Employment Contracts

      Mr. James G. Babb entered into an employment agreement as Chairman,
    President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 1993, for a term
    of five years, as amended.  The agreement provides for a base salary of
    $345,000, as adjusted.  The agreement also provides that Mr. Babb will be a
    participant in the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan and that he will be
    eligible to receive awards of stock options under Outlet Communications'
    stock option plans.  Mr. Babb is further eligible to receive additional
    compensation in the event of a merger or sale of assets pursuant to which
    Outlet Communications' stockholders receive value in excess of $9 per share.
    In the event of termination without cause, Outlet Broadcasting will pay Mr.
    Babb his compensation for twelve months or the remaining portion of his
    employment period, whichever is greater.

      Mr. Douglas E. Gealy entered into an employment agreement as Vice
    President-General Manager of WCMH-TV in May 1993 which remains in effect
    until April 30, 1996.  The contract provides for a base salary of $150,000
    per annum, as adjusted, and also provides that the employee will be a
    participant in the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.  Ms. Sullivan
    entered into an employment agreement as Vice President-General Manager of
    WJAR-TV, effective January 1, 1995, which remains in effect until December
    31, 1996.  The agreement provides for a base salary of $130,000 and also
    provides that the employee will be a participant in the Executive Incentive
    Compensation Plan.  The employment contract of Mr. Oziemblewski with Outlet
    Broadcasting expired as of March 31, 1992.  The contract provides, however,
    that if employment is terminated other than for cause, death or disability
    within a five-year period following the term of the contract, Outlet
    Broadcasting will pay a minimum of one year base salary as severance
    payment. At December 31, 1994 this amounted to $130,000.  In the event of a
    merger of Outlet Communications or Outlet Broadcasting, or acquisition of
    50% of their voting securities, or any other change in control, the
    contracts are deemed to have been assigned to the successor entity.

    Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

      Mr. Koppelman serves as Chairman and Messrs. Butler, Richardson and Walsh
    and Ms. Baldrige serve as members of the Compensation Committee of the
    Board.  No member of the Compensation Committee is a current or former
    officer or employee of Outlet Broadcasting or any of its subsidiaries.  All
    members of the Compensation Committee except Ms. Baldrige were designated by
    Wesray pursuant to the Stockholders' Agreement described below under
    "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions-Stockholders' Agreement."

      Messrs. Richardson and Walsh are stockholders and Messrs. Koppelman,
    Richardson and Walsh are directors of Harding Service, which provides
    management consulting services to Outlet Broadcasting pursuant to an
    agreement entered into in July 1986.  Under the agreement, Harding Service
    has agreed to provide Outlet Broadcasting with general management, corporate
    finance, marketing and business investment advice until July 1996.  Such
    advice includes reviewing capital and operating budgets, capital
    appropriations, executive compensation and employee incentive programs,
    business strategies, budgeting and forecasting, and general corporate
    planning and financial oversight.  Harding Service provides management
    consulting services to several other entities affiliated with Wesray.  In
    consideration of the consulting services, Outlet Broadcasting has agreed to
    pay consulting services fees equal to 0.333% of annual gross revenues to
    Harding Service, which fees totalled $236,630 in 1994.  This agreement was
    entered into when Outlet Communications was privately held and may not be on
    terms as favorable to Outlet Broadcasting as could have been obtained from
    an unaffiliated party.

    Compensation Committee Report

      The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Outlet
    Broadcasting, Inc. (the "Committee") herein presents the following report on
    executive compensation:

         Outlet Broadcasting maintains a Salary Administration Program of which
    the primary purpose is to ensure that Outlet Broadcasting has a credible,
    logical and consistent process for making salary decisions.  The existence
    of such a program enables Outlet Broadcasting to determine that each
    executive receives a fair and reasonable salary for the level of work
    performed and for the quality of that work.  The program also directly
    associates executive compensation with company performance.

    Executive Compensation Policy.  It is the policy of Outlet Broadcasting to
    provide executive compensation that is equitable and competitively
    attractive.  In addition, executive compensation should be related to
    improvements in corporate operating performance.  Thus, compensation will be
    established at levels that are fair and objectively determined and, through
    incentives tied in to performance objectives, will be directly connected
    with increases in the company's value for the ultimate benefit of the
    shareholders.


    Base Compensation.  The Salary Administration Program, as it pertains to
    base compensation, includes the following elements:


    .  Job Evaluation  Establishes the economic value of each job and relates
       the valuation to both the marketplace and other jobs.  This results in
       the development of a salary range for each level of work.

    .  Performance Appraisal  Provides for a fair and equitable review of job
       performance, conducted on a regular basis.

    .  Performance Planning  Combines pay programs with fulfillment of operating
       goals and/or financial objectives.



                                     - 38 -
<PAGE>
 
          The Committee considers that the salary range levels developed for the
    executive officers are reasonable and competitive.  Actual salaries are
    based on the established salary range as further adjusted within that range
    by individual performance contributions.  During fiscal 1994, Outlet
    Broadcasting exhibited substantial growth and continued its favorable
    performance trends.  Operating results in 1994 were marked by significant
    increases in  revenue, operating income and net income.  Outlet
    Broadcasting's financial performance also improved with reductions in long-
    term debt and interest expense.  There was a substantial increase in
    stockholders' equity.  Also in 1994, Outlet Broadcasting added two
    independent UHF television stations to its operations.  In recognition of
    Outlet Broadcasting's overall positive performance, the Committee granted
    the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (the "Named
    Executives") an increase in base salary.

    Executive Incentive Compensation Plan  Key management employees are eligible
    to participate in Outlet Broadcasting's Executive Incentive Compensation
    Plan.  Participants are selected based on ability to affect profitability,
    with awards based primarily on the attainment of certain annual operating
    objectives.  The plan is intended to reward specific operating
    accomplishments and provide competitive levels of compensation for the
    attainment of those financial objectives.  In particular, the plan aims to
    focus  activities toward optimum and steady earnings growth which, the
    Committee believes, are primary determinants of stockholder value  over
    time.  Under the plan, target awards are established for executive officers
    as a percentage of their base salary range.  The targeted awards are subject
    to decrease or increase based on actual performance and at the discretion of
    the Committee.  The Committee may also grant discretionary awards to certain
    key employees.  During 1994, Outlet Broadcasting exceeded its financial
    performance objectives and incentive compensation awards were made to the
    Named Executives as shown in the Summary Compensation Table, to be paid in
    1995.

    Stock Incentive Program  The Committee believes that by encouraging stock
    ownership in Outlet Communications by executives, it serves to increase the
    executives' personal interest in Outlet Broadcasting's continued success and
    progress.  Therefore, executives are eligible to receive stock options
    and/or restricted shares, giving them the right to purchase shares of Common
    Stock of Outlet Communications at a specified price in the future.  The size
    of individual stock grants is based upon job responsibility and individual
    contribution to Outlet Broadcasting's success.  Previous stock option grants
    are considered when awards are determined.

          In view of the substantial improvement in operating and financial
    results over the past three year period, and to provide additional
    incentives to further improve Outlet Broadcasting's performance in 1995 and
    beyond, individual stock options were granted in 1994 to the Named
    Executives and other key employees.  In granting these options, the
    individuals were provided with an immediate financial interest in increasing
    stockholder value.

                                     - 39 -
<PAGE>
 
          In addition, the Committee, subject to shareholder approval, has
    approved an amendment to the 1992 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the
    number of shares of Common Stock available thereunder by 300,000 shares,
    which shares would then be used for future stock option grants or restricted
    share awards.


    Compensation for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Mr. James G.
    Babb, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer joined Outlet
    Broadcasting in May 1991.  His employment agreement  was structured to
    provide Mr. Babb with a competitive base salary, subject to annual review,
    along with an annual incentive opportunity.  In considering Mr. Babb's
    compensation for 1994, the Committee reviewed such compensation arrangements
    and further reviewed the trend of the company's operating performance during
    the year.  It was noted that the company significantly exceeded its
    financial operating objectives for 1994.  In particular, the Committee noted
    that the 1994 financial performance as measured by various factors,
    including revenue growth, expense control, operating income and net income
    per share, was a continuation of Outlet Broadcasting's significantly
    improved financial performance since 1992.  The Committee also noted that
    Outlet Broadcasting successfully added two independent UHF television
    stations to its operations in 1994.

          Because of the growth and considerable success enjoyed by Outlet
    Broadcasting in its 1994 operating results, and because its accomplishments
    will further serve to benefit long-term business prospects, the Committee
    has made the following determinations regarding the compensation of Mr.
    Babb:


    .  Upon annual review, Mr. Babb's base salary was increased from $305,000
       per year to $345,000 per year.

    .  Under the annual incentive compensation plan, an incentive award of
       $225,000 was accrued for fiscal 1994.

    .  Under the 1992 Stock Incentive Plan, non-qualified and incentive stock
       options were awarded for an aggregate 90,000 shares of Outlet
       Communications' Common Stock, of which 45,000 are exercisable at $13.00
       per share (fair market value on date of grant) and 45,000 are exercisable
       at $1.00 per share.  The Committee approved the discounted options for
       Mr. Babb to reflect his importance to the company's future success.

    Limitations on the Deductibility of Compensation  Pursuant to the 1993
    Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, a portion of annual compensation payable
    after 1993 to any of the five highest paid executive officers is not
    deductible for federal income tax purposes to the extent such officer's
    overall compensation exceeds $1 million.  Qualifying performance-based
    incentive compensation, however, is both deductible and excluded for
    purposes of calculating the $1 million base.  Outlet Broadcasting has
    determined that no portion of anticipated compensation payable to any
    executive officer in 1995 will be non-deductible.  Compensation includes the
    "spread" or excess of the fair market value of the shares received upon
    exercise of a stock option over the exercise price.  The spread on the
    discounted stock options granted to Mr. Babb in 1994 will not constitute
    qualified performance-based compensation.  Accordingly, the amount of
    compensation attributable to such spread will not be deductible for federal
    income tax purposes to the extent that Mr. Babb's total compensation (other
    than qualifying performance-based compensation) exceeds $1 million in any
    year.  This is likely to occur if the stock price continues to increase or
    if Mr. Babb exercises a substantial portion of the discounted options in a
    single year.  The Committee has determined that the negative impact of the
    loss of deductibility for a portion of this non-cash compensation expense is
    outweighed by the need to compensate Mr. Babb appropriately and adequately
    for his contributions to Outlet Broadcasting's success and to recognize his
    importance to long-term business prospects.  The Committee will continue to
    address the issue of deductibility in formulating compensation arrangements
    for executive officers.

    Summary  All members of the Committee are nonemployee directors who are
    independent of any relationships with any executive.  As described above,
    the Committee believes that the Salary Administration Program for executives
    is competitive and that the executive compensation programs include variable
    compensation opportunities that are based on achievements of financial
    objectives and enhancements in shareholder value.

    Compensation Committee:  Julius Koppelman, Chairman, and Members  Letitia
    Baldrige, Robert C. Butler, Frank E. Richardson and Frank E. Walsh, Jr.

    Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
              -----------------------------------------------

    Stockholders' Agreement Outlet Communications, Outlet Broadcasting, and each
    of Outlet Communications' original stockholders (including MBL Life
    Assurance Corp., successor to Mutual Benefit) and certain of their
    successors and assigns are parties to a stockholders' agreement (the
    "Stockholders' Agreement"). As of March 17, 1995, an aggregate of 4,156,579
    shares of Outlet Communications Common Stock were beneficially owned by the
    parties to the Stockholders' Agreement. The Stockholders' Agreement requires
    that the stockholders party to the Stockholders' Agreement vote their shares
    to fix the number of directors of Outlet Communications at 14 and elect as
    directors five persons designated by certain management stockholders (the
    "Management Stockholders") and nine persons designated by the stockholders
    affiliated with Wesray (the "Wesray Stockholders"). The following persons
    are parties to the Stockholders' Agreement: Hugh J. Byrnes, Richard D.
    Ferrier, Maria E. Ferrier, The Hartington Trust, Keith Hightower, John D.
    Howard, Julius Koppelman, Frank H. Pearl and selected trust, Frank E.
    Richardson, E. Burke Ross, Jr., William E. Simon, Manfred L. Steyn, Henrik
    N. Vanderlip, The OCI Trust, (Wesray Stockholders), Reginald Butts, Steve J.
    Caminis, Charles G. Conklin, Estate of David E. Henderson and related
    trusts, Frederick R. Griffiths, Thomas J. Mosher, Felix W. Oziemblewski,
    Gerald T. Plemmons, Josephine Renola, Garland R. Robinson, John D. Sawhill,
    Gerald Scher, Mara L. Snodgrass, Solomon M. Yas, Joseph A. Young (Management
    Stockholders) and MBL Life Assurance Corp. 

    The Stockholders' Agreement also provides that each stockholder and MBL Life
    Assurance Corp. may not agree to sell any securities to a buyer who would as
    a result of such purchase own more than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock
    of Outlet Communications unless prior to such sale the buyer agrees to be
    bound by the Stockholders' Agreement and affords each stockholder the
    opportunity to sell a pro rata portion of his shares on the same terms and
    conditions.

    The Stockholders' Agreement terminates on the earlier of (i) December 9,
    1996; (ii) the date that the Wesray Stockholders, Management Stockholders
    and MBL Life Assurance Corp. own an  aggregate of less than 50% of Outlet
    Communications issued and outstanding Common Stock; and (iii) the date of an
    event of bankruptcy or insolvency of Outlet Communications or Outlet
    Broadcasting or foreclosure or similar actions or proceedings by the senior
    bank lender.  Mutual Benefit was placed in rehabilitation by the New Jersey
    Commissioner of Insurance on July 16, 1991 and is currently in liquidation.
    MBL Life Assurance Corp. is the transferee of certain assets formerly held
    by Mutual Benefit, including the holdings of Mutual Benefit in Outlet
    Communications' Common Stock.

    Management Consulting Agreement  In July 1986, Outlet Broadcasting  entered
    into an agreement for management consulting services with Harding Service,
    of which Mr. Richardson and Mr. Walsh are stockholders and Messrs.
    Koppelman, Richardson and Walsh are directors.  For a description of the
    agreement with Harding Service, see "Compensation Committee Interlocks and
    Insider Participation."

                        Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors
Outlet Broadcasting, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Outlet
Broadcasting, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholder's equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 14(a). These financial statements and the schedule are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and the schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Outlet Broadcasting, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 4 and 9 to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement benefits
other than pensions.

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                              December 31, 1994


1. Basis of Presentation

Outlet Broadcasting, Inc. (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Outlet Communications, Inc. (the Parent Company). The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Outlet Broadcasting, Inc. (the Company)
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. At December 31, 1994, the Company's
operations consist of two owned VHF television stations and one owned UHF
television station along with one UHF television station operated under
a local marketing agreement. All material intercompany accounts are
eliminated.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Revenues

Broadcasting stations derive revenue from the sale of program time and spot
announcements to local, regional and national advertisers, and from compensation
received from carrying network programs and commercials. Advertising revenue
and network compensation are recognized in the period during which the program
time and spot announcements are broadcast. Revenue is also derived from
the production of film and taping of advertising materials. Production
revenue is recognized in the period when the service is provided.

Deferred revenue represents a one-time payment received upon renewal of
the Company's affiliation with a broadcasting network which will be amortized
into revenue over the term of the affiliation. The amount of deferred revenue
to be amortized over the ensuing period of twelve months is included in
current liabilities.

Film Contract Rights

Film contract rights are recorded when the license period begins and the
program is available for showing.  The costs of film contract rights are
amortized on accelerated methods over the contract period or as the program
is used, whichever provides the greater amortization on an accumulated basis.
The costs of programs expected to be used within one year are classified
as a current asset. Payments for film contracts are made pursuant to
contractual terms over periods that are generally shorter than the lives
of the rights.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on
the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the property
and equipment varying from 3 to 40 years.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets primarily include network affiliation agreements, station
licenses and goodwill and are being amortized using the straight-line method
up to 40 years.

Income (loss) Per Share

Income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock - 1,000,000 shares.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company operates television stations which serve the Columbus and
Chillicothe, Ohio; Providence, Rhode Island--New Bedford, Massachusetts
and Raleigh--Durham (Fayetteville, Goldsboro and Rocky Mount), North Carolina
markets. The Company grants credit to customers, substantially all of whom
are either local advertisers within these markets or national advertising
agencies.

3. Acquisition and Local Marketing Agreement

In March 1994, the Company entered into a local marketing agreement ("LMA")
with the licensee of UHF television station WWHO, Chillicothe, Ohio. Under
the agreement, the Company will serve as a broker for the sale of WWHO's
advertising time and provide it with certain programming and operating
capabilities. The Company's obligations commenced April 18, 1994 and, since
that date, results of operations for WWHO are included with those of the
Company. The Company made an initial investment in the LMA of $1,055,000
which included an option, valued at $475,000, to purchase the station. The
total investment is being amortized over the initial ten-year term of the
LMA. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse the licensee for certain
annual operating expenses and debt service which, during 1994, totaled
$392,000. The Company has also agreed to share with the licensee specified
percentages of net operating income, as defined in the LMA. In this regard,
the Company is allowed to recover its aggregate investment (excluding the
option) and operating expense and debt service payments from the net revenue
of WWHO prior to making percentage payments from net operating income. There
were no such payments required in 1994. The LMA will automatically renew
for two additional periods of five years unless canceled by the Company.

On August 10, 1994, the Company purchased the assets and broadcast license
of television station, WNCN (formerly WYED), for an aggregate price of
$5,478,000. WNCN is an independent television station licensed to Goldsboro,
NC, and broadcasts in the Raleigh--Durham (Fayetteville, Goldsboro, and
Rocky Mount), North Carolina market area. Funds for the acquisition were
provided by the Company's internal operations. The transaction was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting. Results of operations for WNCN
are included with those of the Company subsequent to the date of acquisition.
Pro forma net revenue, net income and net income per share for 1994 and
1993 would not have been significantly different from the actual historical
amounts.

4. Income Taxes (continued)

Pursuant to tax regulations released in 1994, the Company allocated to equity
certain proceeds received from a prior year's issuance of debt and related
common stock purchase warrants, thereby increasing the Company's net operating
loss carryover by $13,301,000 and increasing the deferred tax asset and
the related valuation reserve by $4,745,000.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" and adjusted
previously recorded deferred taxes. The Company has reflected the effect
of adopting Statement 109 as a change in accounting principle at the beginning
of 1993. The cumulative effect of the change increased net income for the
year ended December 31, 1993 by $4,434,000 or $4.43 per share.

Deferred income taxes represent the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, at currently enacted
rates. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and
assets as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, are as follows:

On June 28, 1993, the Company entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement
(the Agreement) with a bank under which the bank agreed to provide a secured
senior credit facility consisting of a term loan in the principal amount
of $25,000,000 and revolving loans in the maximum principal amount outstanding
of $5,000,000. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments through
September 30, 1998. Amounts outstanding on the revolving loan would be payable
in three fluctuating quarterly installments no later than June 30, 1999.
The Agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee equal to 1/2% of
the unused portion of the revolving loan. The Agreement also provides for
principal payments based on the immediately preceding fiscal year's excess
cash flow, as defined in the Agreement, commencing July 1, 1995; however,
the principal payment due July 1, 1995 has been waived by the bank. On July
15, 1993, in a public offering, the Company issued 10 7/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2003 in the principal amount of $60,000,000.

5. Long-term Debt (continued)

The loan and notes payable contain certain covenants that, among other
things, limit the ability of the Company to incur debt, pay cash dividends
on or repurchase capital stock (as defined in the Agreement), enter into
certain transactions with affiliates, acquire and/or dispose of certain
assets and engage in mergers and consolidations. The obligations were entered
into in order for the Company to undertake a refinancing of its outstanding
long-term debt, which was completed during 1993. As a result of the
refinancing, the Company incurred one-time debt extinguishment costs in
the amount of $1,826,000, net of income taxes, reported as an extraordinary
loss during the year ended December 31, 1993.

During 1993, the Company repaid in full its Junior Subordinated Note payable
to The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company. Interest on the note was payable
(i) at the rate of 9% per annum (which interest was accrued and added
semiannually to the principal amount of the note through August 1, 1991),
and (ii) semiannually thereafter, based on the note's principal amount of
$50,000,000, with payments commencing on February 1, 1992, and continuing
until maturity on February 1, 1997, at 12.5% per annum. The note was recorded
at a discounted value at an effective interest rate of 17.2%, which was
being amortized over the term of the note. The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance
Company is a shareholder of the Parent Company.

Cash payments for interest during the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
and 1992 were $8,096,000, $13,071,000 and $13,150,000, respectively.

Annual maturities of long-term debt during each of the next five years are
as follows (dollars in thousands): 1995-$4,500; 1996-$5,000; 1997-$5,500;
1998-$4,500; 1999-none.

Rent expense for all operating leases was approximately $604,000, $692,000,
and $796,000, for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

The Company has commitments to acquire approximately $10,992,000 of film
contract rights at December 31, 1994. The Company has also agreed to reimburse
the licensee of television station WWHO for certain annual operating and
debt service expenses over the duration of the LMA. The reimbursement for
1995 is estimated at $612,000 and, in subsequent years, may approximate
that amount.

At December 31, 1994, the Company remains contingently liable on approximately
$12,884,000 of store leases expiring on various dates through 2007, applicable
to a retail division, which was sold as of the fiscal year ended January
31, 1983. Substantially all of the leases have been assumed by others, and
management believes that future payments, if any, would not be material
to the Company's financial statements. In connection with the sale of
television stations to third parties, the Company also remains contingently
liable on approximately $4,600,000 of building and tower leases related
to radio and television stations sold in March 1990.

7. Nonrecurring Items and Extraordinary Loss

The extraordinary loss in 1993 represents debt extinguishment costs as
described in Note 5. Nonrecurring items in 1992 represent a gain on the sale
of real estate, net of write-offs of marketable securities in the amount
of $148,000.

8. Commissions

Net revenue for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992 are net
of agency and national representative commissions of approximately $11,547,000
$9,140,000 and $8,877,000, respectively.

9. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has both qualified and nonqualified noncontributory pension plans
covering all employees age 21 or over with one year of service, excluding
certain collective bargaining groups. Pension costs are actuarially computed.
The Company's policy is to fund amounts as are necessary on an actuarial
basis to provide for benefits in accordance with the requirements of ERISA.
Benefits are based on (i) the three consecutive years in which compensation
affords the highest average, and (ii) total years of service. Net pension
costs for the indicated years ended December 31 consist of:

9. Employee Benefit Plans (continued)

On September 1, 1994, the Company established the Outlet Broadcasting Inc.
401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the Plan), which qualifies under Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code, for the benefit of substantially all employees
not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless the agreement allows
for participation in the Plan. The Plan allows the employees to contribute up
to 15% of their regular earnings. The Company contributes, for the personal
account of each employee, 25% of the first 6%. Plan expense in 1994 was
approximately $67,000. In addition, the Company may make discretionary profit
sharing contributions annually.

The Company provides postretirement medical reimbursement benefits to elected
corporate officers who have met certain service requirements. Most of eligible
participants are currently retired. As of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" which requires the cost of
providing postretirement medical reimbursement benefits to be accrued over the
eligible employees' service period. Prior to 1993, the Company expensed these
benefits as they were paid. As permitted by the new standard, the Company
elected to recognize its accumulated postretirement benefit of obligation at
January 1, 1993, on a delayed basis.

The following table provides information on the status of the medical
reimbursement benefit plan as of December 31:

</TABLE>

The Company's policy is to fund postretirement benefits as claims are paid. The
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using a discount
rate of 8% and a health care cost trend rate of 6%, declining to 5% in the year
2000 and thereafter. The effect of a 1% annual increase in these assumed cost
trend rates would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $83,000; the annual costs would not be materially affected.

13. Litigation

During 1993, a representative body of the television broadcast industry reached
an agreement with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers
(ASCAP) as to the total industry's obligation for the payment of music
performance rights fees to that organization. The agreement provided that each
television station's performance rights fees payable to ASCAP would generally
approximate what the stations had paid to date. Accordingly, the Company
reversed an accrued liability of $2,100,000 which provided for the Company's
potential additional exposure in this matter.

The Company is also subject to litigation arising from its normal business
operations. Any liability which may result therefrom, to the extent not
provided by insurance or accruals, would not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position.

        (a)  Compensation.
             ------------

             (i)  Base Salary.  Executive shall receive: a base salary of
                  -----------  
One Hundred Thirty Thousand Dollars ($260,000) per year, payable in regular
bimonthly installments ("Base Salary").

             (ii)  Adjustment.  Executive's basic compensation shall be reviewed
                   ----------  
periodically by the Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee
of the Board and adjusted in accordance with Outlet's Salary Administration
Program, entitling Executive to be benefitted by the Program's provision
governing salary increases.

        (b)  Incentive Compensation.  In addition to the Base Salary, Executive
             ----------------------
shall be eligible to earn incentive compensation as a participant in Outlet's
Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.

     5.  Fringe Benefits.
         ---------------

        (a)  Generally. Executive shall be entitled to any and all benefits
             ---------
made available to Executive management-level employees of the Corporation
and such other benefits as the Board may from time to time, in its discretion,
make to Executive.

        (b)  Insurance.
             ---------
             (i) Medical and Health Coverage. Executive shall be eligible

        (c)  Pension.  Executive shall be entitled to participate, if eligible,
             -------
in the Corporation's current retirement plan and supplemental retirement
plan.

        (d)  Vacation.  Executive shall be entitled to receive paid vacation
             --------
annually, in accordance with existing Corporation policy.

        (e)  Reimbursement for Reasonable Business Expenses.  The Corporation
             ----------------------------------------------
shall reimburse Executive for reasonable expenses incurred by her in connection
with her performance of duties pursuant to this Agreement.

        (f)  Automobile.  During the Employment Period, the Corporation
             ----------
shall provide Executive with full use of an automobile similar to vehicles
provided to other

                                       2
       
<PAGE>
 
management-level employees owned or leased by the Corporation for use in
carrying out her duties for both the Corporation and for use in such additional
personal business as Executive may deem appropriate. The Corporation agrees
to provide adequate insurance for the automobile and occupants and to pay
all maintenance and operating costs appropriate or necessary to maintain
such automobile in prime operating condition.

     6.  Termination of Employment.
         -------------------------

         (a)  Termination for Just Cause.  During the term of this Agreement,
              --------------------------
the Corporation shall be entitled to terminate Executive's employment at
any time for Just Cause upon not less than sixty (60) days written notice
to Executive specifying the cause and the date of termination. For this
purpose, "Just Cause" shall mean fraud, conviction of a felony, dishonesty,
gross negligence in the performance of her duties to the Corporation, willful
misconduct in the performance of her duties to the Corporation, willful
misrepresentation to shareholders and directors which is materially injurious
to the Corporation, willful failure to comply with a reasonable written order
of the Board of Directors and material breach of this Agreement. In the
event of such termination, payments for Base Salary and vested rights to
fringe benefits shall be prorated to the date of termination. All other
obligations of the Corporation hereunder shall cease as of the date of
termination.

         (b)  Termination for Death or Permanent Incapacity.  In the event
              ---------------------------------------------
of Executive's death while employed hereunder or if Executive's employment
hereunder is terminated by reason of permanent incapacity, as herein provided,
Corporation shall continue to pay the base salary specified in subparagraph
4(a)(i) above through the end of the month in which such event occurs; and
Executive shall also be entitled to a pro rata portion of the Incentive Bonus,
if any, based on actual performance of Corporation, which Executive would
have earned had she continued in its employ for the balance of the year
in which such event occurs using the ratio to twelve months of the number
of months of that year to and including the month in which such event occurs.

         If during the term of this Agreement Executive should become disabled,
through illness or otherwise, from performing her duties hereunder, Executive
shall be entitled to a leave of absence from corporation for the duration
of any such disability up to but not

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
exceeding six months in any one twelve-month period. Executive's base salary
retainer and Incentive Bonus and her status as an employee hereunder shall
continue during any such leave of absence. Executive shall be deemed to
be permanently incapacitated only if and when her leaves of absence for
disability shall have continued beyond those specified in this paragraph
and thereafter upon impartial medical advice it shall have been certified
to corporation that the disability is such that it will substantially impair
her ability to perform her duties hereunder.

     (c)  Termination Without Just Cause.  During the term of this Agreement,
          ------------------------------
the Corporation shall be entitled to terminate Executive's employment without
Just Cause upon not less than sixty (60) days' written notice to Executive
specifying the date of termination; provided however, that if this Agreement
is terminated by the Corporation for any reason other than for Just Cause,
or if the Agreement is terminated by the Corporation for any reason which
the Corporation believes constitutes Just Cause, and it is ultimately determined
that Executive was wrongfully terminated, Executive shall continue to receive
her Base Salary in the amount and manner as if both parties had fully performed
their obligations under this Agreement for the Employment Period
notwithstanding such termination.

     7.  Noncompetition.  The Corporation and Executive agree that the
         -------------- 
Corporation's customer contacts and relations are established and maintained
at great expense and that Executive by virtue of employment under this
Agreement, will have unique and extensive exposure to the personal contact
with the Corporation's customers and that she will be able to establish
a unique relationship with those customers and the opportunity, both during
and after employment, to unfairly compete with the Corporation (which term,
for purposes of this paragraph 7, shall include the Corporation, or any
affiliate or subsidiary of the Corporation which provides similar products
and services). Therefore, Executive and the Corporation agree as follows:

     (a)  During Term of Employment.  Executive agrees during her employment
          -------------------------
with the Corporation that she shall not, directly or indirectly, either
individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder, consultant,
or in any other capacity participate in, engage in, or have a financial
or other interest in any business which is directly competitive

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
with the Corporation or any successor or assign of the Corporation. The
ownership of an interest constituting not more than one percent (1%) of
the outstanding debt or equity in a corporation whose shares are traded
in a recognized stock exchange or trade in the over-the-counter market,
even though the corporation may be a competitor of the Corporation, shall
not be deemed financial participation in a competitor.

     (b)  Upon Termination of Employment.  Executive agrees that upon
          ------------------------------
termination of employment with the Corporation, for a period of one (1) year
after December 31, 1996, or the termination date of her employment with
the Corporation, whichever date is later, she will not, directly or indirectly,
individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder, consultant,
or in any other capacity, canvass, contact, solicit or accept on behalf of
himself or any other corporation, any customers with whom Executive had
personal contact or whose account Executive personally serviced or supervised
while employed hereunder, for the purpose of providing services, products
or business directly competitive with those then being provided by
the Corporation, in the city in which the Executive was employed.

     8.  Confidentiality.  In the course of her employment with the Corporation
         ---------------
prior to the date hereof Executive had, and in the course of her employment
hereunder Executive will have, access to confidential information and records,
data, formulae, specifications and other trade secrets of the Corporation
and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Confidential Information"). During
and after her employment by the Corporation, Executive shall not directly
or indirectly disclose Confidential Information to any person or use any
Confidential Information, except as required in the course of such employment.
All records, files, drawings, documents, models, equipment and the like relating
to the Corporation's or any of its affiliates' or subsidiaries' business,
which Executive shall prepare or use or come into contact with, shall be
and remain such company's sole property and shall not be removed from such
company's premises without its written consent, except as required in the
course of such employment.

     9.  Specific Performance.  In the event of any controversy concerning
         -------------------- 
the rights or obligations under this Agreement, such rights or obligations
shall be enforceable in a court of equity by a decree of specific performance.
Such remedy, however, shall be

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
cumulative and nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedy
to which the parties may be entitled.

     10.  Sale, Consolidation or Merger.  In the event of a sale of the
          -----------------------------
stock of the Corporation, or consolidation or merger of the Corporation with
or into another corporation or entity, or the sale of substantially all of
the operating assets of the Corporation to another corporation, entity or
individual, the Corporation's successor-in-interest shall be deemed to have
assumed all liabilities of the Corporation under this Agreement.

     11.  Waiver.  The failure of either party to insist, in any one or
          ------
more instances, upon performance of the terms or conditions of this Agreement
shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of any right granted
hereunder or of the future performance of any such term, covenant or condition.

     12.  Notices.  Any notice to be given hereunder shall be deemed sufficient
          -------
if addressed in writing, and delivered by registered or certified mail or
delivered personally, in the case of the Corporation, to its principal business
office and in the case of Executive, to her address appearing on the records
of the Corporation, or to such other addresses as he may designate in writing
to the Corporation.

     13.  Severability.  In the event that any provisions shall be held
          ------------
to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, it is agreed such
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement and the remaining covenants, restrictions, and provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect and any court of competent jurisdiction
may so modify the objectionable provision as to make it valid, reasonable,
and enforceable.

     14.  Amendment.  This Agreement may be amended only by an agreement
          ---------
in writing signed by the parties hereto.

     15.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement contains the entire agreement
          ----------------
of the parties with respect to Executive's employment by the Corporation
and supersedes any prior or simultaneous agreements between them, whether
oral or written.

     16.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
          -------------
in accordance with the laws of the State of Rhode Island.


                                       6
<PAGE>
 
     17.  Coverage.  The provisions set forth in this Agreement with respect
          --------
to the terms and conditions of Executive's employment will not prevent
Executive from participating in any other employee compensation or benefit
program adopted by the Corporation for its key employees solely because such
programs are not specifically mentioned in this Agreement.

     18.  Benefit.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
          -------
benefit of and shall be enforceable by and against the Corporation, its
successors and assigns, and Executive, her heirs, beneficiaries, and legal
representatives. It is agreed that the rights and obligations of Executive
may not be delegated or assigned except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed or caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the day, month and year first above written.

carrying out his duties for both the Corporation and for use in such additional
personal business as Executive may deem appropriate. The Corporation agrees

      6. Termination of Employment.
         -------------------------

         (a) Termination for Just Cause. During the term of this Agreement,
             --------------------------
the Corporation shall be entitled to terminate Executive's employment at
any time for Just Cause upon not less than sixty (60) days written notice
to Executive specifying the cause and the date of termination. For this
purpose, "Just Cause" shall mean fraud, conviction of a felony, dishonesty,
gross negligence in the performance of his duties to the Corporation, willful
misconduct in the performance of his duties to the Corporation, willful
misrepresentation to shareholders and directors which is materially injurious
to the Corporation, willful failure to comply with a reasonable written
order of the Board of Directors and material breach of this Agreement. In
the event of such termination, payments for Base Salary and vested rights
to fringe benefits shall be prorated to the date of termination. All other
obligations of the Corporation hereunder shall cease as of the date of
termination.

         (b) Termination for Death or Permanent Incapacity. In the event
             ---------------------------------------------
of Executive's death while employed hereunder or if Executive's employment
hereunder is terminated by reason of permanent incapacity, as herein provided,
Corporation shall continue to pay the base salary specified in subparagraph
4(a)(i) above through the end of the month in which such event occurs; and
Executive shall also be entitled to a pro rata portion of the Incentive
Bonus, if any, based on actual performance of Corporation, which Executive
would have earned had he continued in its employ for the balance of the
year in which such event occurs using the ratio to twelve months of the
number of months of that year to and including the month in which such event
occurs.

         If during the term of this Agreement Executive should become disabled,
through illness or otherwise, from performing his duties hereunder, Executive
shall be entitled to a leave of absence from corporation for the duration
of any such disability up to but not

                                      3
<PAGE>
 
exceeding six months in any one twelve-month period. Executive's base salary
retainer and Incentive Bonus and his status as an employee hereunder shall
continue during any such leave of absence. Executive shall be deemed to
be permanently incapacitated only if and when his leaves of absence for
disability shall have continued beyond those specified in this paragraph
and thereafter upon impartial medical advice it shall have been certified
to corporation that the disability is such that it will substantially impair
his ability to perform his duties hereunder.

        (c) Termination Without Just Cause. During the term of this Agreement,
           ------------------------------
the Corporation shall be entitled to terminate Executive's employment without
Just Cause upon not less than sixty (60) days' written notice to Executive
specifying the date of termination; provided however, that if this Agreement
is terminated by the Corporation for any reason other than for Just Cause,
or if the Agreement is terminated by the Corporation for any reason which
the Corporation believes constitutes Just Cause, and it is ultimately
determined that Executive was wrongfully terminated, Executive shall continue
to receive his Base Salary in the amount and manner as if both parties had
fully performed their obligations under this Agreement for the Employment
Period notwithstanding such termination.

     7. Noncompetition. The Corporation and Executive agree that the
        --------------
Corporation's customer contacts and relations are established and maintained
at great expense and that Executive by virtue of employment under this
Agreement, will have unique and extensive exposure to the personal contact
with the Corporation's customers and that he will be able to establish a
unique relationship with those customers and the opportunity, both during
and after employment, to unfairly compete with the Corporation (which term,
for purposes of this paragraph 7, shall include the Corporation, or any
affiliate or subsidiary of the Corporation which provides similar products
and services). Therefore, Executive and the Corporation agree as follows:

       (a) During Term of Employment. Executive agrees during his employment
           -------------------------
with the Corporation that he shall not, directly or indirectly, either
individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder, consultant,
or in any other capacity participate in, engage in, or have a financial
or other interest in any business which is directly competitive with the

                                      4
<PAGE>
 
Corporation or any successor or assign of the Corporation. The ownership
of an interest constituting not more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding
debt or equity in a corporation whose shares are traded in a recognized
stock exchange or trade in the over-the-counter market, even though the
corporation may be a competitor of the Corporation, shall not be deemed
financial participation in a competitor.
   
        (b) Upon Termination of Employment. Executive agrees that upon
            ------------------------------
termination of employment with the Corporation, for a period of one (1)
year after December 31, 1996, or the termination date of his employment
with the Corporation, whichever date is later, he will not, directly or
indirectly, individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder,
consultant, or in any other capacity, canvass, contact, solicit or accept
on behalf of himself or any other corporation, any customers with whom
Executive had personal contact or whose account Executive personally serviced
or supervised while employed hereunder, for the purpose of providing services,
products or business directly competitive with those then being provided
by the Corporation, in the city in which the Executive was employed.

     8. Confidentiality. In the course of his employment with the Corporation
        --------------- 
prior to the date hereof Executive had, and in the course of his employment
hereunder Executive will have, access to confidential information and records,
data, formulae, specifications and other trade secrets of the Corporation
and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Confidential Information"). During
and after his employment by the Corporation, Executive shall not directly
or indirectly disclose Confidential Information to any person or use any
Confidential Information, except as required in the course of such employment.
All records, files, drawings, documents, models, equipment and the like
relating to the Corporation's or any of its affiliates' or subsidiaries'
business, which Executive shall prepare or use or come into contact with,
shall be and remain such company's sole property and shall not be removed
from such company's premises without its written consent, except as required
in the course of such employment.

     9. Specific Performance. In the event of any controversy concerning the
        --------------------
rights or obligations under this Agreement, such rights or obligations shall
be enforceable in a court of equity by a decree of specific performance.
Such remedy, however, shall be

                                      5
<PAGE>
 
cumulative and nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedy
to which the parties may be entitled.

     10. Sale, Consolidation or Merger. In the event of a sale of the stock
         -----------------------------
of the Corporation, or consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or
into another corporation or entity, or the sale of substantially all of
the operating assets of the Corporation to another corporation, entity or
individual, the Corporation's successor-in-interest shall be deemed to have
assumed all liabilities of the Corporation under this Agreement.

     11. Waiver. The failure of either party to insist, in any one or more
         ------
instances, upon performance of the terms or conditions of this Agreement
shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of any right granted
hereunder or of the future performance of any such term, covenant or condition.

     12. Notices. Any notice to be given hereunder shall be deemed sufficient
         -------
if addressed in writing and delivered by registered or certified mail or
delivered personally, in the case of the Corporation, to its principal business
office and in the case of Executive, to his address appearing on the records
of the Corporation, or to such other addresses as he may designate in writing
to the Corporation.

     13. Severability. In the event that any provisions shall be held to
         ------------
be invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, it is agreed such
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement and the remaining covenants, restrictions, and provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect and any court of competent jurisdiction
may so modify the objectionable provision as to make it valid, reasonable,
and enforceable.

     14. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by an agreement in
         ---------
writing signed by the parties hereto.

     15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement
         ----------------
of the parties with respect to Executive's employment by the Corporation
and supersedes any prior or simultaneous agreements between them, whether
oral or written.

     16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
         -------------
in accordance with the laws of the State of Rhode Island.

                                      6
<PAGE>
 
     17. Coverage. The provisions set forth in this Agreement with respect
         --------
to the terms and conditions of Executive's employment will not prevent
Executive from participating in any other employee compensation or benefit
program adopted by the Corporation for its key employees solely because
such programs are not specifically mentioned in this Agreement.

     18. Benefit. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
         -------
benefit of and shall be enforceable by and against the Corporation, its
successors and assigns, and Executive, his heirs, beneficiaries, and legal
representatives. It is agreed that the rights and obligations of Executive
may not be delegated or assigned except as specifically set forth in this
AGreement.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed or caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the day, month and year first above written.

    6.  Termination of Employment.
        -------------------------

        (a)  Termination for Just Cause.  During the term of this Agreement, the
             --------------------------
Corporation shall be entitled to terminate Executive's employment at any time
for Just Cause upon not less than sixty (60) days written notice to Executive
specifying the cause and the date of termination. For this purpose, "Just Cause"
shall mean fraud, conviction of a felony, dishonesty, gross negligence in the
performance of his duties to the Corporation, willful misconduct in the
performance of his duties to the Corporation, willful misrepresentation to
shareholders and directors which is materially injurious to the Corporation,
willful failure to comply with a reasonable written order of the Board of
Directors and material breach of this Agreement. In the event of such
termination, payments for Base Salary and vested rights to fringe benefits shall
be prorated to the date of termination. All other obligations of the Corporation
hereunder shall cease as of the date of termination.

       (b)  Termination for Death or Permanent Incapacity.  In the event
            --------------------------------------------
of Executive's death while employed hereunder or if Executive's employment
hereunder is terminated by reason of permanent incapacity, as herein provided,
Corporation shall continue to pay the base salary specified in subparagraph
4(a)(i) above through the end of the month in which such event occurs; and
Executive shall also be entitled to a pro rata portion of the Incentive
Bonus, if any, based on actual performance of Corporation, which Executive
would have earned had he continued in its employ for the balance of the
year in which such event occurs using the ratio to twelve months of the
number of months of that year to and including the month in which such event
occurs.

       If during the term of this Agreement Executive should become disabled,
through illness or otherwise, from performing his duties hereunder, Executive
shall be entitled to a leave of absence from corporation for the duration
of any such disability up to but not exceeding six months in any one
twelve-month period. Executive's base salary retainer and


                                      3
<PAGE>
 
Incentive Bonus and his status as an employee hereunder shall continue during
any such leave of absence. Executive shall be deemed to be permanently
incapacitated only if and when his leaves of absence for disability shall
have continued beyond those specified in this paragraph and thereafter upon
impartial medical advice it shall have been certified to corporation that
the disability is such that it will substantially impair his ability to
perform his duties hereunder.

        (c)  Termination Without Just Cause.  During the term of this Agreement,
             ------------------------------
the Corporation shall be entitled to terminate Executive's employment without
Just Cause upon not less than sixty (60) days' written notice to Executive
specifying the date of termination; provided however, that if this Agreement
is terminated by the Corporation for any reason other than for Just Cause,
or if the Agreement is terminated by the Corporation for any reason which
the Corporation believes constitutes Just Cause, and it is ultimately
determined that Executive was wrongfully terminated, Executive shall continue

fully performed their obligations under this Agreement for the Employment
Period notwithstanding such termination.

    7.  Noncompetition.  The Corporation and Executive agree that the
        --------------
Corporation's customer contacts and relations are established and maintained
at great expense and that Executive by virtue of employment under this
Agreement, will have unique and extensive exposure to the personal contact
with the Corporation's customers and that he will be able to establish a
unique relationship with those customers and the opportunity, both during
and after employment, to unfairly compete with the Corporation (which term,
for purposes of this paragraph 7, shall include the Corporation, or any
affiliate or subsidiary of the Corporation which provides similar products
and services). Therefore, Executive and the Corporation agree as follows:

       (a)  During Term of Employment.  Executive agrees during his employment
            -------------------------
with the Corporation that he shall not, directly or indirectly, either
individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder, consultant,
or in any other capacity participate in, engage in, or have a financial
or other interest in any business which is directly competitive with the
Corporation or any successor or assign of the Corporation. The ownership
of an interest


                                      4
<PAGE>
 
constituting not more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding debt or equity
in a corporation whose shares are traded in a recognized stock exchange
or trade in the over-the-counter market, even though the corporation may
be a competitor of the Corporation, shall not be deemed financial participation
in a competitor.

       (b)  Upon Termination of Employment.  Executive agrees that upon
            ------------------------------
termination of employment with the Corporation, for a period of one (1)
year after December 31, 1995, or the termination date of his employment
with the Corporation, whichever date is later, he will not, directly or
indirectly, individually or as an employee, agent, partner, shareholder,
consultant, or in any other capacity, canvass, contact, solicit or accept
on behalf of himself or any other corporation, any customers with whom
Executive had personal contact or whose account Executive personally serviced
or supervised while employed hereunder, for the purpose of providing services,
products or business directly competitive with those then being provided
by the Corporation, in the city in which the Executive was employed.

    8.  Confidentiality.  In the course of his employment with the Corporation
        ---------------
prior to the date hereof Executive had, and in the course of his employment
hereunder Executive will have, access to confidential information and records,
data, formulae, specifications and other trade secrets of the Corporation
and its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Confidential Information"). During
and after his employment by the Corporation, Executive shall not directly
or indirectly disclose Confidential Information to any person or use any
Confidential Information, except as required in the course of such employment.
All records, files, drawings, documents, models, equipment and the like
relating to the Corporation's or any of its affiliates' or subsidiaries'
business, which Executive shall prepare or use or come into contact with,
shall be and remain such company's sole property and shall not be removed
from such company's premises without its written consent, except as required
in the course of such employment.

    9.  Specific Performance.  In the event of any controversy concerning
        --------------------
the rights or obligations under this Agreement, such rights or obligations
shall be enforceable in a court of equity by a decree of specific performance.
Such remedy, however, shall be cumulative and nonexclusive and shall be
in addition to any other remedy to which the


                                      5
<PAGE>
 
parties may be entitled.

    10.  Sale, Consolidation or Merger.  In the event of a sale of the stock
         -----------------------------
of the Corporation, or consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or
into another corporation or entity, or the sale of substantially all of
the operating assets of the Corporation to another corporation, entity or
individual, the Corporation's successor-in-interest shall be deemed to have
assumed all liabilities of the Corporation under this Agreement.

    11.  Waiver. The failure of either party to insist, in any one or more
         ------
instances, upon performance of the terms or conditions of this Agreement
shall not be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of any right granted
hereunder or of the future performance of any such term, covenant or
condition.

    12.  Notices.  Any notice to be given hereunder shall be deemed sufficient
         -------
if addressed in writing, and delivered by registered or certified mail or
delivered personally, in the case of the Corporation, to its principal business
office and in the case of Executive, to his address appearing on the records
of the Corporation, or to such other addresses as he may designate in writing
to the Corporation.

    13.  Severability.  In the event that any provisions shall be held to be
         ------------
invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, it is agreed such invalidity
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and
the remaining covenants, restrictions, and provisions hereof shall remain in

                              WB COMMUNICATIONS
                        STATION AFFILIATION AGREEMENT

As of September 1, 1994

Outlet Broadcasting
23 Kenney Drive
Cranston, Rhode Island 02920-4489

Attention: Doug Gealy

     The following shall comprise the agreement between WB Communications
("WB," "we," or "us"), and Outlet Broadcasting ("Affiliate" or "you")
for the affiliation of television station WWHO ("Station") with WB for
carriage of WB programming. The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC")
has issued a broadcast license ("License") to Fant Broadcasting as the
Licensee to operate Station in Chillicothe, Ohio, the community in which
Station is licensed by the FCC ("Community of License"). Outlet Broadcasting,
has entered into a Lease Management Agreement ("LMA") with Fant Broadcasting.
Under said LMA, you are the broker for programming on station WWHO and you
have the right and authority to manage the station and to enter into this
Network Affiliation Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "WB
program(s)" and "WB programming" and any variations thereof shall mean
the programming made available by WB under this Agreement.

1. WB Programming: WB will make available to Affiliate WB programs for free
   --------------
   over-the-air broadcast and broadcast by any other means by
   Station in the Community of License during the term of this Agreement. During
   such term, except as otherwise provided herein, WB grants Affiliate the
   exclusive right to have Station broadcast the WB programming in the Community
   of License only as scheduled by WB over free over-the-air television and by
   such other technological means as are available to Affiliate for broadcast in
   the Community of License so long as Station broadcasts the WB programming
   for over-the-air television. WB shall have the sole discretion to select,
   schedule, substitute and/or withdraw WB programming or any portion(s)
   thereof. WB shall also have the right to authorize any television
   broadcasting station, regardless of the community in which it is licensed
   by the FCC, to broadcast any presentation of a subject we deem to be of
   immediate national significance including, but not limited to, a
   Presidential address. Except as provided herein, during the term of this
   Agreement Affiliate shall be the sole affiliate of WB for transmission
   for exhibition on television of WB programming in the Community of License.

2. Program Carriage:
   ----------------

   (a) We agree to make available for broadcast by Station WB programming
       for the hours programmed by WB at the times and dates scheduled by
       WB throughout the term of this Agreement. You acknowledge that the
       times and roll-out dates set forth in this Agreement are approximate
       only and you agree to have Station broadcast WB programs irrespective
       of whether WB meets, fails to meet or otherwise varies from the
       anticipated program schedule set forth herein; provided, however,
       that WB hereby agrees not to accelerate such anticipated program
       schedule. To the extent WB makes available such WB programming for
       broadcast, this Agreement both obligates us to make available such
       WB programs to Station and obligates Station to broadcast such WB
       programs over-the-air pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

   (b) Subject to the exceptions set forth in subparagraph 2(e) and the
       right of preemption set forth in subparagraph 2(f), Station shall
       broadcast WB programs on the dates and at the times scheduled by
       WB. Station shall broadcast WB programs in their entirety, including
       but not limited to WB commercial announcements, WB identifications,
       program promotional material, and credit announcements contained
       in such programs, without interruption or deletion or addition of
       any kind, except for the commercial announcements that Station is
       allowed to add pursuant to Paragraph 5. Notwithstanding the
       foregoing, you may substitute other WB promotional announcements
       in lieu of program promotional material that is inaccurate as it
       pertains to Station's schedule. No commercial announcement,
       promotional announcement or public service announcement will be
       broadcast by Station during any interval within a WB program, which
       interval is designated by WB as being for the sole purpose of
       making a station identification announcement.

   (c) The initial Scheduled Program Times of WB programming and the
       anticipated roll-out dates of that programming are set forth as
       follows (the specified times apply for the Eastern and Pacific
       Time Zones; the Mountain and Central Time Zones are one hour earlier
       for Prime Time and Latenight programming only, except as otherwise
       agreed by us):

                                      - 2 -

<PAGE>
 
       Prime Time: 7:00 p.m.-10:00 p.m. Sunday 8:00 p.m.-10:00 p.m.
                   Monday through Saturday. Two nights, to be designated
                   by us, during the 1994/1995 broadcast year (one night
                   in January 1995 with the second night commencing during
                   the third quarter of 1995); one additional night
                   commencing during the 1995/1996 broadcast year; and one
                   additional night during each broadcast year thereafter
                   until seven nights of programming are made available.

       Children's: 7:00 a.m.-8:00 a.m.; 7:30 a.m.-8:30 a.m.; or 8:00 a.m.-9:00
                   a.m. (at WB's election) Monday through Friday; 3:00 p.m.-
                   5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday; 8:00 a.m.-12:00 noon
                   Saturday; Weekday mornings (one hour) and Saturday mornings
                   (three hours) commencing September 1995; One additional
                   Saturday hour commencing September 1996; Monday through
                   Friday afternoons (two hours) commencing September 1997.
                   It is anticipated that the additional Children's programming
                   will commence in approximately the second week of September.

       Latenight:  11:00 p.m.-12:00 midnight Monday through Friday, commencing
                   not earlier than 1997 and subject to the approval of
                   the WB Affiliate's Council (as defined in Paragraph 13
                   below)

   (d) Notwithstanding the roll-out schedule for Children's afternoon
       programming in subparagraph (c) above, WB's supply of Children's
       afternoon programming shall be subject to the expiration of the current
       agreements between WB affiliates and suppliers of Children's afternoon
       programming. Station agrees not to extend or renew any agreement
       it may have with such suppliers for such programming during the term
       of this Agreement if such renewal or extension would interfere with
       the broadcast of the WB Children's afternoon programming.

                                      - 3 -

<PAGE>
 
   (e) You confirm that as of the date of this Agreement you have no
       commitments, except those listed in Schedule 1 hereto, which would
       impede Station's broadcasting all WB programming made available
       during the term of this Agreement. If any WB programming is not
       broadcast by you because of any such commitment expressly described
       in Schedule 1 (but excluding extensions by exercise of options by
       Affiliate [but not by the programming licensor] or otherwise), then
       such programming shall be broadcast in a time period upon which you
       and we shall mutually agree and which shall be of quality and rating
       value comparable to that of the Scheduled Program Times. These programs
       will not be considered preempted for purposes of subparagraph 2(f).

   (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
       in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or hinder Affiliate
       from (i) rejecting or refusing any WB program which Affiliate reasonably
       believes to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to the public
       interest or (ii) substituting a program which, in Affiliate's opinion,
       is of greater local or national importance. In such an event, you
       shall provide us with advance written notice of any such rejection,
       refusal or substitution, no later than 14 days prior to the air date
       of such programming, except where the nature of the substitute program
       makes such notice impracticable (e.g., coverage of breaking news
       or other unscheduled events) or the programming has not been made
       available to you by such date, in which cases you agree to give us
       as much advance notice as the circumstances permit. Such notice shall
       include a statement of the reasons you believe that the rejected
       WB programming is unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to the
       public interest, and/or that a substituted program is of greater
       local or national importance. In view of the limited amount of WB
       programming to be supplied pursuant to this Agreement (at least until
       such time as the full WB programming schedule has been rolled out)
       you acknowledge that you do not foresee any need to substitute
       programming of greater local or national importance for WB programming,
       except in those circumstances requiring live coverage of fast-breaking
       news events or very infrequent special events. It is acknowledged
       by WB that because you are the broker under an LMA Agreement that
       the broadcast Licensee shall retain the right to reject

                                      - 4 -
<PAGE>
 
       programming pursuant to its obligations as a Licensee of the FCC.

       To the extent you substitute another program for a WB program as
       permitted under subparagraph 2(f)(ii), then you will broadcast such
       omitted program and the commercial announcements contained therein
       (or any replacement programming provided by WB and the commercial
       announcements contained therein) during a time period upon which
       you and we shall promptly and mutually agree and which shall be of
       quality and rating value comparable to that of the preempted program's
       Scheduled Program Time. In the event that the parties do not promptly
       agree upon such a time period after reasonable consultation in good
       faith and after taking into account the practical alternatives under
       the circumstances, then, without limiting any other rights of WB
       under this Agreement or otherwise, we shall have the right to license
       the broadcast rights to the applicable omitted programming (or
       replacement programming) to another television station located in
       the Community of License.

       In addition, if three or more episodes of a program series are
       preempted by you as permitted hereunder in any thirteen-week period,
       for any reasons other than force majeure as provided in Paragraph
       6, we shall have the right, upon 60 days prior written notice, to
       terminate your right to broadcast that program series and to withdraw
       all future episodes of that series. Such thirteen-week periods shall
       be measured consecutively from the first broadcast date of the program
       series in question. If we subsequently place such a series on another
       station in the Community of License, we reserve the right not to
       offer you the broadcast rights to that series for subsequent broadcast
       seasons.

       In addition to all other remedies, to the extent one or more episodes
       of a program series is preempted by you in violation of (i.e., other
       than as permitted under) this Paragraph 2, we shall have the right,
       upon 30 days prior written notice, to terminate your right to broadcast
       the remainder of the program series and withdraw all future episodes
       of that series from you.

   (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or hinder
       WB from (i) substituting one or more WB

                                      - 5 -
       
<PAGE>
 
       programs for previously scheduled WB programs, in which event WB
       will make the substituted programs available to Station pursuant
       to the provisions of Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 3: (ii) cancelling
       one or more WB programs; or (iii) postponing any scheduled roll-out
       dates of WB programming. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall
       be construed to obligate WB (x) to provide a minimum or specific
       number of WB programs; (y) to commence providing WB programming on
       any particular date; or (z) to expand the amount of WB programming
       pursuant to a specified timetable.

3. Delivery: WB agrees to make available the WB programming for satellite
   --------
   transmission by a carrier selected and arranged for by Affiliate or the
   WB Affiliate's Council. Upon request by Affiliate, WB shall provide to
   Affiliate a list of satellite carriers which, to the best of WB's knowledge,
   are transmitting WB programming for other stations. WB shall bear no
   costs incurred in connection with the satellite transmission of the WB
   programming, including the uplink, the downlink therefrom and broadcast
   by Station. Station shall pay no uplink costs.

4. Promotion:
   ---------
   
   (a) We will provide you with on-air promotional announcements ("WB
       Promos") for WB programming, which WB Promos are intended for broadcast
       during Station's broadcast of non-WB programming. You agree to cooperate
       with us in good faith and use your best efforts to provide an on-air
       promotional schedule consistent with our recommendations and consistent
       with Station's good business judgment. You shall maintain complete
       and accurate records of all WB Promos that are broadcast. In the
       event that you find it commercially unreasonable to maintain such
       records, WB will reasonably discuss the nature of the records that
       need to be maintained and the least cumbersome way to maintain the
       necessary records. Upon request by WB for those records, you shall
       provide copies of all such records to WB within two weeks of such
       request.

   (b) You shall budget Station's advertising availabilities in such a manner
       as to enable Station to broadcast additional WB Promos during periods
       in which Station is deemed a "Subperformer." Station shall be deemed
       to be a "Subperformer" from the time its "sweeps rating" is

                                      - 6 -
    


    
<PAGE>
 
       below the average prime time rating for all WB affiliated broadcast
       stations until such time as Station's sweeps rating is no longer
       below the average prime time rating for all WB affiliated broadcast
       stations. The Station's sweeps rating means the Station's average
       A.C. Nielsen rating for the most recently completed sweeps period
       for adults 18-49 for all prime time hours programmed by WB. For such
       time as Station remains a Subperformer, Station shall: (i) broadcast,
       during each one-half hour of all periods of each day that Station
       is broadcasting non-WB programming, at least one (1) 30-second WB
       Promo (or WB Promos aggregating 30 seconds, to the extent we so
       elect) for Station's local, syndicated or WB programming; and (ii)
       broadcast during all periods when Station is broadcasting non-WB
       programming WB Promos for not less than:

       Prime Time Hours Programmed by WB

            2 hours - 20% of 100%
            4 hours - 25%     "
            6 hours - 30%     "
            8 hours - 35%     "
           10 hours - 40%     "
           12 hours*- 45%     "

           (* 12 or more hours)

       (the "Applicable Percentage") or the total, aggregate gross ratings
       points ("GRPs") for all the promotional announcements broadcast
       by Station ("Aggregate Promotional GRPs") within the periods in
       which non-WB programming is being broadcast. The specific WB Promos
       broadcast by Station and the number of broadcasts of each WB Promo
       may be specified by WB and the broadcast of the WB Promos shall be
       made so that the Aggregate Promotional GRPs allocated to WB Promos
       are distributed fairly and reasonably across the periods when non-WB
       programming is being broadcast. For such time as Station's sweeps
       rating ranks Station within the bottom 50% (ranked highest to lowest)
       of those WB affiliated broadcast stations that are Subperformers,
       then the Applicable Percentage for Station shall be not less than
       55% of 100% of the Aggregate promotional GRPs. The WB Promos broadcast
       during each half-hour of non-WB programming, as required by this
       subparagraph 4(b), may be counted toward Station's Applicable
       Percentage. Stations shall continue

                                      - 7 -
<PAGE>
 
       to air WB Promos under this schedule until Station is no longer a
       Subperformer, as defined above. WB acknowledges that there will be
       cross-promotion of Station on another station operated by you in
       the market. In the event that you should determine that the
       subperforming station formula is not workable in the particular
       case of Station WB will discuss alternatives with you in good faith.

   (c) In addition to providing WB Promos, we shall make available for your
       use, at reasonable cost, such other promotional and sales materials
       as we and you may mutually consider appropriate. You shall not delete
       any copyright, trademark, logo or other notice, or any credit included
       in any such materials relating to WB, and you shall not exhibit,
       display, distribute or otherwise use any trademark, logo or other
       material or item delivered pursuant to this Paragraph 4 or otherwise,
       except as instructed by us at the time.

   (d) Commencing on the first date that WB programming is aired by Station
       and for the remaining term of this Agreement, Station shall identify
       itself as a WB affiliate, both on and off-the-air. Prior to the
       "Launch Date" (as defined in subparagraph 9(b)), Station shall
       identify itself as a WB affiliate only after WB gives Affiliate
       permission to do so and only in a manner reasonably directed by WB.
       prior to the Launch Date, Affiliate shall not, without the express
       written permission of WB, make any disclosures to the press or business
       community or issue any press announcements about the Station's
       affiliation with WB.

5. Commercial Announcements:
   ------------------------

   (a) With respect to WB programming, the parties to this Agreement shall
       be entitled to insert the following number of commercial announcements
       (Station's allotment includes station breaks but excludes 5-second
       prime time station identification breaks at the beginning of each
       hour):

       (1) Prime Time (as defined in subparagraph 2(c)) hour (pro-rated
           for half-hour programs):

               You shall have the right to insert six 30-second commercial
               announcements. WB shall

                                      - 8 -

<PAGE>
 
               have the right to insert sixteen 30-second commercial
               announcements.

       (2) Children's:
           Weekday half-hour:

               You shall have the right to insert six 30-second commercial
               announcements (or other material constituting "commercial
               matter" under the FCC's regulations). WB shall have the
               right to insert six 30-second commercial announcements.

           Weekend half-hour:

               You shall have the right to insert five 30-second commercial
               announcements (or other material constituting "commercial
               matter" under the FCC's regulations). WB shall have the
               right to insert five 30-second commercial announcements and
               one 15-second commercial.

       (3) Latenight (as defined in subparagraph 2(c)):

               You will receive half the total number of commercial
               announcements as specified by WB or less as mutually
               agreed to.

   (b) If the amount of commercial advertising, commercial matter or other
       non-program time included in WB programming is reduced for any reason
       (including but not limited to the adoption or modification of statutes
       or regulations or any other governmental action), then we shall be
       entitled to reduce the number of commercial announcements available
       to you to the extent necessary to provide WB and Affiliate with the
       same proportionate amount of commercial time (inclusive of station
       breaks with respect to Affiliate) that each party is entitled to
       under this Agreement.

   (c) Your broadcast over Station of the commercial announcements included
       by us in WB programming is of the essence to this Agreement, and
       nothing contained in this Agreement (other than in subparagraph 2(f))
       shall limit our rights or remedies relating to your failure to so
       broadcast said commercial announcements. You shall

                                      - 9 -

<PAGE>
 
       maintain complete and accurate records of all commercial announcements
       broadcast as provided herein. Within two weeks following each request
       by us therefor, you will submit copies of all such records to WB.

6. Force Majeure: WB shall not be liable for failure to make available any
   -------------
   programming or any portion(s) thereof, and Station shall not be liable
   for failure to broadcast any such programming or any portion(s) thereof,
   by reason of any act of God, equipment failure, action or claims by any
   third person, labor dispute, law, governmental regulation or order, or
   other cause beyond either party's reasonable control ("force majeure
   event"). If due to any force majeure event, we substantially fail to
   make available all of the programming to be delivered to Affiliate under
   the terms of this Agreement, or you substantially fail to broadcast such
   programming as scheduled by WB for four consecutive weeks, or for six
   weeks in the aggregate during any 12-month period, then the "non-failing"
   party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty 30 days prior written
   notice to the "failing" party so long as such notice is given at any
   time prior to the "non-failing" party's receipt of actual notice that
   the force majeure event(s) has ended; provided further, however, that
   notwithstanding the above provisions, you shall not have any right to
   so terminate this Agreement, upon a force majeure event or otherwise,
   if we: (i) fail to make available a minimum or specific number of WB
   programs; (ii) fail to commence making available WB programming on any
   particular date; (iii) fail to expand the amount of WB programming
   pursuant to a specified timetable; (iv) substitute one or more WB programs
   for previously scheduled WB programs; (v) cancel one or more WB programs;
   or (vi) postpone the roll-out of any WB programming.

7. Assignment or Transfer: Affiliate shall not assign or transfer any of
   ----------------------
   its rights, obligations or privileges under this Agreement, by operation
   of law or otherwise, without WB's prior written consent, which consent shall
   not be unreasonably withheld after taking into consideration the business
   interests of WB. Any purported assignment or transfer by you, without
   such prior consent, shall be null and void and of no effect. WB will
   employ all reasonable efforts to analyze any proposed transfer of Station
   to a third party, and will not unreasonably refuse to allow the assignment
   of the WB affiliation. You also agree that if any application is made
   to the FCC pertaining to any purported, attempted or actual assignment
   or transfer of control of the License (except as to

                                      - 10 -



<PAGE>
 
   "short form" (as described below) assignments or transfers of control
   which do not involve a material assignment or transfer of control), or
   any interest in Affiliate, Station or the License, you shall immediately
   notify WB in writing of the filing of such application. In the event
   of a purported, attempted or actual assignment or transfer of control
   of the License (except as to "short form" assignments or transfers
   of control made pursuant to Section 73.3540(f) of the FCC's rules),
   WB shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, effective upon
   30 days advance written notice, which notice may be given at any time
   until 90 days after the last occurring of: (a) the date on which we learn
   that such assignment or transfer (voluntary or involuntary) has become
   effective, (b) the date on which we receive written notice of such
   assignment or transfer, or (c) the effective date of this Agreement.
   The foregoing termination provisions shall apply to any assignments or
   transfers of control that become effective at any time on or after the
   beginning of the sixth month prior to the date of this Agreement.

   If we do not so terminate this Agreement, you shall, upon our request,
   procure and deliver to us in a form satisfactory to us, the agreement
   of the proposed assignee or transferee that, upon consummation of the
   assignment or transfer of control, the assignee or transferee will assume
   and perform this Agreement in its entirety without limitation of any
   kind. If you fail to notify WB of the proposed assignment or transfer
   of control of Station or the License, or fail to procure the agreement
   of the proposed assignee or transferee in accordance with this
   Paragraph 7, then we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
   upon 30 days advance written notice.

8. Unauthorized Copying: You shall not, and shall not cause or authorize
   --------------------
   others to record, copy or duplicate any programming or other material
   we furnish pursuant to this Agreement, in whole or in part, and you shall
   take all reasonable precautions to prevent any such recording, copying
   or duplication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Station is located
   in the Mountain Time Zone you may pre-record WB programming for later
   broadcast at the times scheduled by us. You shall erase all such
   pre-recorded programming promptly after its scheduled broadcast.
   Notwithstanding the above provisions, Station may make a non-broadcast
   quality recording of its entire broadcast day for archival, file and
   reference purposes and uses only, which copy shall be kept in Station's
   possession at all times.

9. Term:
   ----

   (a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on September 1, 1994 and
       shall continue for 36 months following the Launch Date (the "initial
       period"). After the initial period, the term of this Agreement may
       be extended for additional successive periods of two years each,
       by us, in our sole discretion, giving written notice of such extension
       to you at least 120 days prior to the expiration of the then-current
       period; provided, however, that if, within 30 days of your receipt
       of the notice of extension, you, in your sole discretion, give us
       written notice that you reject such extension, then the extension
       notice shall not be effective and this Agreement shall terminate
       upon expiration of the then-current period.

   (b) The "Launch Date" shall be the date on which WB first makes WB
       programming available to Affiliate for broadcast by Station on a
       regularly scheduled basis.

   (c) Each "Contract Year" hereunder shall be an annual period during
       the term of this Agreement. The First Contract Year is the annual
       period beginning on the Launch Date; the Second Contract Year is
       the annual period commencing one year after the Launch Date, etc.

   (d) During the initial period, WB shall, within its sole discretion and
       without liability, have the right to terminate this Agreement so
       long as we (i) provide sixty days prior written notice to you and
       (ii) are either: (A) ceasing operation as a television network; or
       (B) substantially restructuring the ownership of the television
       network. In the event of a termination pursuant to this subparagraph,
       Station shall maintain its cable position at least until the date
       that the initial term hereof would have ended, but for the earlier
       termination.

   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
       upon the termination or expiration of the term of this Agreement,
       all of your rights to broadcast or otherwise use any WB program or
       any trademark, logo or other material or item hereunder shall
       immediately cease and neither you nor Station shall have any further
       rights whatsoever with respect to any such program, trademark, logo,
       material or item.

10. Applicable Law: The obligations of you and WB under this Agreement are
    --------------
    subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and
    regulations (including, but not limited to, the Communications Act of
    1934, as amended, and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC)
    and this Agreement and all matters or issues collateral thereto shall
    be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to
    California's conflict of law rules.

11. Station Acquisition by WB: During the term of this Agreement, WB agrees
    -------------------------
    that neither we nor Time Warner Inc. nor any of its subsidiary companies
    will acquire, as defined by the attribution rules of the FCC, a television
    broadcast station licensed in the Community of License.

12. Change in Operations: In the event that Station's transmitter location,
    --------------------
    power, frequency, programming format or hours of operation are materially
    changed at any time during the term of this Agreement so that Station
    is of materially less value to us as a broadcaster of WB programming
    than at the date of this Agreement, then we shall have the right to
    terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice. You shall
    notify WB immediately in writing if application is made to the FCC to
    modify in a material manner the transmitter location, power or frequency
    of Station or if Affiliate plans to modify in a material manner the
    hours of operation of Station. If you fail to notify us as required
    herein, then we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by
    giving you 30 days prior written notice.

13. WB Affiliates Council: You, with the other affiliates of WB, shall form
    ---------------------
    a WB Affiliates Council (the "Council"), which shall be comprised
    of representatives from five different affiliates of WB.

14. Non-Liability of Council Members: To the extent the Council and its
    --------------------------------
    members are acting in their capacity as such, then the Council and each
    member so acting shall not have any obligation or legal or other liability
    whatsoever to you in connection with this Agreement, including without
    limitation, with respect to the Council's or such member's approval
    or non-approval of any matter, exercise or non-exercise of any right
    or taking of or failing to take any other action in connection therewith.

15. Warranties and Indemnities:
    --------------------------

    (a) WB agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Affiliate harmless against
        and from all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising
        out of the use by Station under this Agreement of any WB program
        or other material furnished by WB under this Agreement, provided
        that Affiliate promptly notifies WB of any claim or litigation to
        which this indemnity shall apply, and provided further that Affiliate
        cooperates fully with WB in the defense or settlement of such claim
        or litigation. Affiliate agrees to indemnify, defend and hold WB
        harmless against and from all claims, damages, liabilities, costs
        and expenses with respect to Affiliate's operation of the Station
        or any material furnished, added or deleted to or from WB programming
        by Affiliate. This indemnity shall not apply to litigation expenses,
        including attorneys' fees, that the indemnified party elects to
        incur on its own behalf. Except as otherwise provided in this
        Agreement, neither Affiliate nor WB shall have any rights against
        the other for claims by third persons, or for the failure to operate
        facilities or to furnish WB programs if such failure is the result
        of a force majeure event as defined in Paragraph 6. Furthermore,
        notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Affiliate
        shall not have any rights against WB for claims by third parties
        or Affiliate arising out of any actions or omissions of WB permitted
        under subparagraph 2(g).

    (b) You agree to maintain for Station such licenses, including performing
        rights licenses as now are or hereafter may be in general use by
        television broadcasting stations and are necessary for you to
        broadcast the television programs which we furnish to you hereunder.
        We will clear all music in the repertory of SESAC, ASCAP and BMI
        used in our programs, thereby licensing the broadcasting of such
        music in such programs over Station. You will be responsible for
        all music license requirements (and all other permissions) for any
        commercial or other material inserted by you within or adjacent
        to WB programs in accordance with this Agreement.

    (c) You warrant that the License is in good standing and you agree to
        comply with all relevant statutes and FCC rules and requirements
        so as to maintain the License in good standing. In the event you
        are found to have materially violated any laws or FCC rules or
        requirements (after the exhaustion of all appeals so long as Station
        retains the License during the pendency of such appeal), the effect
        of which is that Station is of materially less value to us as a
        broadcaster of WB programming than as of the date of this Agreement,
        then we shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon
        30 days prior written notice. You shall notify us immediately of
        any action by the FCC imposing any forfeitures or other sanction(s)
        on Station or you including but not limited to short-term renewals,
        revocation or denial of renewal.

    (d) You warrant that all information delivered by you to us in connection
        with this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects,
        including, without limitation, the information required in connection
        with Plan A attached hereto if you elect that Plan.

    (e) You warrant that execution of this Agreement and performance of
        its obligations will not violate or result in a default under
        (i) any material agreement or instrument to which you are party or
        (ii) any statute, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation in
        any material respect, or order, judgment, injunction, decree or
        ruling of any court or administrative agency applicable to you,
        which default would materially interfere with the performance of
        your obligations hereunder.

    (f) You warrant that you are not a party to any legal action or other
        proceeding before any court or administrative agency which could
        prohibit the performance of your obligations under this Agreement.

16. Retransmission Consent: If any law, governmental regulation or other
    ----------------------
    action permits you to elect to require any cable television system or
    other multichannel video program distributor to obtain your consent
    to such system's or distributor's retransmission of Station's broadcast
    of either Station's signal as a whole or any WB programming included
    therein, then Affiliate and WB agree to negotiate in good faith regarding
    whether such consent is to be given (including without limitation, whether
    you shall or shall not, in lieu of requiring consent, elect to require
    any cable system to comply

                                      - 15 -



<PAGE>
 
    with any "must carry" rules, regulations or laws) and, if so, the
    terms under which such consent is to be given (including without
    limitation, the amount and type of compensation, if any, to be paid
    by the system or distributor for such consent and whether any of that
    compensation shall be shared between you and us). It is acknowledged
    that the retransmission rights of Station are owned and controlled
    by the owner of the Station. However, in the event that you should
    obtain such rights as a part of your LMA then you shall negotiate with
    WB as provided in this paragraph. Further you will employ reasonable
    efforts to have the owner of the Station negotiate with WB in good faith.

17. Network Non-Duplication Protection: During the term of this Agreement,
    ----------------------------------
    Affiliate shall be entitled to network non-duplication protection,
    as provided by Sections 76.92 through 76.97 of the FCC's rules, against
    the presentation of any WB program by a cable system during the period
    commencing one day before and ending fourteen (14) days after receipt
    of such WB program by Station. The geographic zone of network
    non-duplication protection shall be the Designated Market Area ("DMA")
    (as defined by Nielsen) in which your Station is located or any lesser
    zone mandated by Sections 76.92 and 73.658(m) of the FCC's rules as
    those rules exist as of the date of this Agreement. Network non-duplication
    protection shall extend only to WB programs that Station is carrying
    in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such protection shall
    be subject to the terms and provisions of subparagraph 2(f). You are
    under no obligation to exercise in whole or in part the network
    non-duplication rights granted herein.

18. Affiliation Payments: Affiliate agrees to pay to WB, at Affiliate's
    --------------------
    election, made at the time of execution hereof by designating the
    appropriate selection on the signature page of this Agreement, either
    the sums set forth in subparagraphs 18 A(1) and A(2) or the sums set
    forth in subparagraph 18 B; these payments are intended to compensate
    WB for the WB programming and are in no way intended to, nor do they,
    confer on WB any ownership or other equity interest in Station. If you
    fail to so designate Plan A or Plan B where indicated, you shall be
    deemed to have selected Plan B.

                                      PLAN A
                                      ------

    A(1) Station Disposition Payment. Upon the occurrence of a sale or
         ---------------------------
         refinancing of the Station or disaffiliation under certain
         circumstances, Affiliate shall pay to WB an

                                      - 16 -




<PAGE>
 
         amount equal to 25% of the difference between the value of the
         Station at the time of such event and the value of the Station
         immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, all as
         defined and set forth in Paragraph A of the Plan A Exhibit
         attached hereto.

    A(2) Net Ordinary Operating Cash Flow Payments. As a non-refundable
         -----------------------------------------
         advance to be credited against the Station Disposition Payment,
         Affiliate shall pay to WB, on an annual basis, 25% of the amount
         by which Station's ``ordinary operating cash flow'' annually
         exceeds that average annual amount of such cash flow that the
         Station generated during its last two full fiscal years prior to
         the date of this Agreement, all as defined and set forth in
         Paragraph B of the Plan A Exhibit attached hereto.

                                      PLAN B
                                      ------

    B.   Affiliation Ratings Payments. Affiliate shall pay to WB an annual
         ----------------------------
         payment, based on the Station's television market ratings, for
         WB prime time programming, commencing with the initial broadcast
         by Station of such programming, all as defined and set forth in
         the Plan B Exhibit attached hereto.

19. Notices and Reports:
    -------------------

    (a)  In addition to any other reports or forms requested herein, you
         will provide to us in writing, in the manner reasonably requested
         by WB, such reports covering WB programs broadcast by Station as
         we may request from time to time. To the extent we provide you
         forms for such purpose, you shall provide such reports on these
         forms.

    (b)  All notices, reports or forms required or permitted hereunder to
         be in writing shall be deemed given when personally delivered
         (including, without limitation, by overnight courier or other
         messenger or upon confirmed receipt of facsimile copy) or on the
         date of mailing postage prepaid, addressed as specified below,
         or addressed to such other address as such party may hereafter
         specify in a written notice. Notice to Affiliate shall be to the
         address set forth for Affiliate on page 1 of this Agreement.
         Notice to WB shall be to: WB Communications, 4000 Warner Boulevard,
         Burbank, California, 91522, Attention: General Counsel.

20. Miscellaneous:
    -------------

    (a) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any partnership,
        association, joint venture, fiduciary or agency relationship between
        the parties hereto.

    (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement nor the conduct of any officer,
        director, agent or employee of either WB or Affiliate shall be deemed
        to create or to constitute ownership by WB, in whole or in part,
        of Affiliate, Station or the License or in any way constitute a
        derogation of the rights, duties and responsibilities imposed upon
        Affiliate. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to delegate
        to WB, directly or indirectly, any right to control the operations
        of Station.

    (c) You shall at all times permit us, in connection with WB programming,
        without charge, to place on, maintain and use at Station's premises,
        at our expense, such equipment as WB shall reasonably require. Station
        shall operate such equipment for us, to the extent we reasonably
        request, and no fee shall be charged by Station therefor. It is
        agreed that no equipment that is not customarily used at broadcast
        stations will be placed at Station. In the event that Station believes
        that the placement of the equipment is unreasonable, then Station
        and WB will enter into good faith negotiations about the placement
        of such equipment.

    (d) No waiver of any failure of any condition nor of the breach of any
        obligation hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding
        or succeeding failure of the same or any other condition, or a
        waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other
        obligation.

    (e) Each and all of the rights and remedies of WB and Affiliate under
        this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more
        of said rights or remedies shall not preclude the exercise of any
        other right or remedy under this Agreement, at law or in equity.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
        in no event shall either party hereto be entitled to recover any
        lost profits or consequential damages because of a breach or failure
        by the other party, and except as expressly provided in this Agreement
        to the contrary, neither WB nor Affiliate shall have any right against
        the other with respect to claims by any third person or other third
        entity.

                           ------------------------

     This TIME BROKERAGE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made as of March
18, 1994, among Outlet Broadcasting, Inc., a Rhode Island ("Broker"), and
Fant Broadcasting Company of Ohio, Inc., an Alabama corporation ("Licensee"),
and with respect to paragraph 5.2, Outlet Communications, Inc. ("OCI), a

                             W I T N E S S E T H:
                             - - - - - - - - - -

     WHEREAS, Broker is in the business of producing and transmitting news,
sports, informational, public service and entertainment programming and
associated advertising on Television Station WCMH (TV), Columbus, Ohio;
and

     WHEREAS, Licensee, as of the date of this Agreement noted above, is
the licensee of the Television Station presently operating with the call
letters WWAT (TV) in Chillicothe, Ohio (the "Station") and as of that date
owns certain of the Station's assets; and

     WHEREAS, Broker desires to utilize its currently held assets as well
as assets it will acquire to provide programming to be transmitted on the
Station at such time as Licensee becomes the Station's licensee, pursuant
to the provisions hereof and pursuant to applicable regulations and policies
of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"); and

     WHEREAS; Licensee desires to accept and transmit programming supplied
by Broker on the Station while maintaining control over the Station and
continuing to broadcast Licensee's own public interest programming; 

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual
promises, undertakings, covenants and agreements of the parties contained
in this Agreement, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

ascertained needs and concerns, including children's programming; provided,
however, Licensee shall have the right and obligation to broadcast such
additional noncommercial programming, either produced or purchased by Licensee,
as it determines appropriate to respond to the ascertained issues of community
concern ("Licensee Programming"); provided, further, however, beginning
on the Commencement Date, as defined below in paragraph 4.1 and continuing
through 11:59 p.m. on April 17, 1994, (the "Transition Period"), Licensee
shall have the right to transmit commercial programming ("Transition

consideration of any kind is received by Licensee.

     1.3 Preemption. Licensee may preempt or delete any Brokered Programming
         ----------
which Licensee believes to be unsatisfactory, unsuitable or contrary to
the public interest, and to substitute programming which, in Licensee's
opinion, is of greater local or national importance.

to Broker at no cost. To the extent Licensee requests the use of assets
owned by Broker to produce or broadcast the programming specified in paragraphs

2.1 hereof, Broker shall make the use of such assets available to Licensee
pursuant to an Equipment Lease to be executed in the form set out in Exhibit
A.

to maintain in good working order the Station's equipment used in connection
with the broadcast of the Station's program material. Broker shall bear

be necessary to maintain the Station's equipment in good working order;
provided, however, that Broker's obligation to bear exclusive responsibility
--------  -------
for all necessary capital expenditures for the maintenance and improvement
of the transmission facilities licensed to the Station shall be limited
to the Initial Term and first Renewal Term and shall also be limited in
amount to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00), exclusive of any recovery

faith to enter into an appropriate agreement with Licensee for the provision
of programming by Broker for that facility on terms consistent with this
Agreement.

                                 ARTICLE III
                                CONSIDERATION
                                -------------

     3.1 Fee. Starting on the Commencement Date, as defined below, Broker
         ---
shall pay to Licensee a monthly fee calculated according to the provisions
set forth in Section 3 of Exhibit B. In further consideration of the
programming transaction contemplated under this Agreement as well as the
right to renew the Agreement as provided in paragraph 4.2, Broker shall
pay to Licensee the sum of Five Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars
($525,000.00) ("Initial Payment") in cash. Of this amount, Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000.00) has already been delivered to Licensee by letter
of Broker dated February 28, 1994. The remaining Four Hundred Seventy Five
Thousand Dollars ($475,000.00) shall be delivered on the Commencement Date.
The New Operating Income, as defined in Exhibit B, shall be shared in
accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B.

     3.2 Adjustments.
         -----------
       
         (a) Effective at the end of the Transition Period, Licensee may
broadcast up to two hours of Licensee Programming per week pursuant to
paragraph 1.2 without any adjustment to the fee set out in paragraph 3.1.
If at any time following the Transition Period and continuing during the
term of the Agreement, the Station shall fail to carry Brokered Programming
for all but the two hours per week specified in this paragraph 3.2, the
fee payable to Licensee by Broker shall be reduced by the then-current market
rate of the advertising time scheduled during any deleted or preempted Brokered
Programming. During the Transition Period, there shall be no reduction in
the fee payable to Licensee by Broker for the then-current market rate of
the advertising time scheduled during any deleted or preempted Brokered
programming.

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 3.2(a), the
fee payable to Licensee by Broker shall not be reduced if Licensee determines,
in its good faith judgment, that noncommercial Licensee Programming, as
defined in paragraph 1.2, of more than two hours per week is necessary to
meet FCC requirements or to meet Licensee's obligations as an FCC licensee.

                                  ARTICLE IV
                      TERM AND SECURITY FOR PERFORMANCE
                      ---------------------------------

                                      4

<PAGE>
 
     4.1 Initial Term. The Initial Term of this Agreement shall commence
         ------------
on the date noted above by the parties (the "Commencement Date") and shall
expire on the final day of the ten-year period following the Commencement
Date, unless otherwise renewed.

     4.2 Renewal Term. This Agreement shall automatically renew for two
         ------------
additional periods of five years each ("Renewal Terms"), unless Broker provides
written notice of nonrenewal within 180 days prior to the expiration of
the Initial Term.

     4.3 Cancellation. Licensee shall have the unlimited right to cancel
         ------------
this Agreement at any time upon provision of twelve months' written notice
to Broker, such advance notice being necessary in view of the substantial
financial commitments Broker will be required to incur in order to provide
high quality programming for transmission on the Station; provided, however,
                                                          --------  -------
that upon cancellation of this Agreement by Licensee under this paragraph,
there shall be a final accounting of monies due but unpaid under this
Agreement; and provided further that Broker shall be entitled to Liquidated
               -------- -------
Damages under paragraph 4.6 herein.

     4.4 Termination for Refusal To Transmit Programs. Effective at the end of
         --------------------------------------------
the Transition Period, in the event that Licensee refuses to transmit
programming under this agreement (except as a result of Broker's default under
any of its obligations herein or except as provided in paragraph 9.1) for either
twenty-four (24) consecutive hours or one-half hour in each day in any period of
thirty (30) consecutive days, Broker shall have the right, exercisable at any
time within sixty (60) days after the end of such period, to terminate this
Agreement as of any date within 120 days of the date Broker notifies Licensee of
its election to terminate this Agreement. If such termination shall occur
pursuant to this paragraph, such termination shall extinguish and cancel this
Agreement without further liability of Broker to Licensee; provided, however,
                                                           --------  -------
that, upon termination of this Agreement by Broker under this paragraph, there
shall be a final accounting of monies due but unpaid under this Agreement; and
provided further that Broker shall be entitled to Liquidated Damages, as defined
-------- -------
in paragraph 4.6 herein.

     4.5 Termination for Default and Nonperformance. Except as is provided
         ------------------------------------------
in paragraph 4.4, should either party be in breach of this Agreement for
the nonperformance of a material obligation, this Agreement may be terminated
by the non-defaulting party if such breach shall continue with respect to
monetary defaults for a period of five (5) days and, with respect to
non-monetary defaults, for a period of fifteen (15) days following the receipt
of written notice from the non-defaulting party ("Cure Period"), which notice
shall indicate the nature of such default; provided, however, that there
                                           --------  -------
shall be a final accounting of monies due but

                                      5
<PAGE>
 
unpaid under this Agreement and provided further that if such termination
                                -------- -------
is due to the default of Licensee, Broker shall be entitled to Liquidated
Damages, as defined in paragraph 4.6 herein. The Cure Period shall be extended
as necessary for those non-monetary defaults which cannot be cured within
fifteen (15) days, provided that the defaulting party is diligently working
with all reasonable haste to remedy such default.

     4.6 Liquidated Damages.
         ------------------

     (a) Licensee acknowledges that Broker has made a substantial advance
payment in order to enter into this Agreement; that Broker will acquire
certain assets associated uniquely with the Station's operation and will
enter into various long-term agreements with program suppliers and other
third parties to produce programming for the Station at substantial expense
and risk; that Broker will recruit, hire and maintain a staff of employees
dedicated to acquiring and producing quality programming to be broadcast
on the Station; and that Broker will make substantial investments in additional
hard assets to produce quality programming for the Station. Licensee also
acknowledges that Broker will make substantial investments, both in tangible
and intangible terms, to promote the Station under this Agreement, to create
a unique image for the Station, and to develop a competitive position in
the market for the Station and that such efforts on the part of Broker will
add substantial value to the Station. Licensee and Broker hereby acknowledge
and agree that any measure of actual damages cannot compensate Broker for
the loss of Licensee's performance under this Agreement and that the true
measure of damages to Broker for a cancellation, termination, or material
breach of this Agreement by Licensee or by Broker pursuant to paragraphs
4.3, 4.4, or 4.5 is incapable of accurate estimation with reasonable certainty.
Licensee and Broker therefore agree that it is a fair and reasonable forecast
of just compensation for the harm caused to be measured by liquidated damages,
as defined in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, to be paid to Broker upon
the cancellation, termination or breach of this Agreement by Licensee.

     (b) "Liquidated Damages" shall mean an amount equal to funds expended
and/or committed to be expended by Broker (except (i) with respect to items
(2) through (8) below, such expenditures and/or commitments as are consistent
with industry practices and (ii) to the extent not theretofore recovered
by Broker from Gross Revenues as defined by Exhibit B prior to the
cancellation, termination, or breach) in each of the following categories:

         (1) the Initial Payment;

         (2) the full value of all service contracts and programming agreements
assumed and entered into by Broker

                                      6
     
<PAGE>
 
for purposes of providing programming and advertising to be broadcast on
the Station, which Broker owns at the time of cancellation, termination
or breach, less any consideration received by Broker as a consequence of
its good faith efforts to sell or assign such agreements;

         (3) the full value of all severance and employee benefit packages
that Broker, in its discretion, shall provide to employees whose services
would not be required in the absence of this Agreement;

         (4) the full value of any contracts with third parties, which could
not be performed owing to cancellation or termination, for services to be
rendered in connection with programming provided to the Station including,
without limitation, producers, advertising salespeople, technicians, engineers,
and any other independent contractors whose services would not be required
in the absence of this Agreement;

         (5) the full value of all expenses incurred to promote the Station
and position the Station in the marketplace;

         (6) the full value of assets acquired by Broker for the purpose
of initially implementing this Agreement and of all Capital Expenditures
incurred subsequently in connection with this Agreement, less
any consideration received by Broker as a consequence of its good faith
efforts to sell any such assets;

         (7) all corporate, legal, administrative, professional and brokerage
expenses relating in any way to this Agreement; and
   
         (8) the good will and intangible value associated with Broker's
efforts under this Agreement to create a unique image and competitive market
position for the Station, giving due consideration to the fact that the
option and right of first refusal contained in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 shall
survive cancellation or termination of this Agreement.

     (c) Should Licensee cancel, terminate or materially breach this Agreement,
Broker shall submit its computation of Liquidated Damages under the categories
set forth above to a "Big Six" accounting firm mutually acceptable to the
parties for independent auditing and verification. Within thirty (30) days
of verification, Licensee agrees to tender payment of all verified amounts
to Broker; provided, however, that if Licensee objects to any particular
enumerated component of the Liquidated Damages, as verified, it shall notify
Broker of such objection within fifteen (15) days of verification. If thereafter
Broker

                                      7
<PAGE>
 
and Licensee cannot agree as to the amount of the objectionable component,
either party shall have the right to elect to arbitrate such dispute provided
it gives written notice of its election to arbitrate by the thirtieth (30th)
day following the date of Licensee's objection to Broker's verification.
All arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and
shall be in Columbus, Ohio. In any proceeding, the arbitrators shall be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement. The prevailing party in any
arbitration proceeding shall be entitled to enforce such award in any court
of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding that Licensee may question a
particular component of the Liquidated Damages and either party may elect
arbitration of the dispute, the remainder of the items comprising the Liquidated
Damages shall be paid by Licensee to Broker within thirty (30) days of
accounting verification, as specified above. No payment shall be required
as to any contested component until the earlier of (i) Broker and Licensee
reaching an agreement on the amount or (ii) entering of the arbitration
award.

     (d)  If any category of Liquidated Damages is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remainder
of the categories of Liquidated Damages shall not be affected thereby,
and the parties agree to use their best efforts to negotiate a replacement
category that is neither invalid, illegal nor unenforceable.

     4.7  Security for Performance.  Licensee's performance under this Agreement
          ------------------------
shall be secured by a security interest in all of Licensee's and Station's
assets, junior only to that certain mortgage and security agreement of even
date herewith between Licensee and Triplett & Associates, Inc., an Ohio
corporation, to secure the obligation of Licensee under that certain promissory
note in original face amount of One Million Four Hundred Seventy Five Thousand
Dollars ($1,475,000.00) also of even date herewith ("Triplett Obligation").
The form of the Security Agreement is attached as Exhibit C. In addition,
Licensee's performance under this Agreement shall be secured by the personal
guarantee of Anthony J. Fant as a pledgor of the Licensee stock that he
holds. If additional individuals or entities shall acquire stock of Licensee,
Licensee's performance under this Agreement shall be further secured by
personal guarantees of such shareholders as pledgors of the Licensee stock
that they hold. The pledge agreement(s) shall provide that the Broker shall
not take any action which would constitute or result in an assignment of
license or change of control of Licensee without first obtaining FCC approval
if such assignment or change of control would require that approval. In
addition, the pledge agreement(s) shall provide that (i) voting rights will
remain with the Licensee, even in the event of its default; (ii) in the
event of default, there will be either a private or public sale of the


                                      8
<PAGE>
 
stock; and (iii) prior to the exercise of stockholder rights by the purchaser
at such sale, the prior consent of the FCC will be obtained. The forms of
the Personal Guaranty and Pledge Agreement are attached, respectively, as
Exhibits D and E.

     4.8  Specific Performance.  The rights to be transferred pursuant to
          --------------------
the terms of this Agreement are unique and not readily available on the
open market. For that reason and others, Broker will be damaged seriously
and irreparably injured should this transaction not be performed through
no fault of its own, but for reasons attributable to Licensee. Accordingly,
the Broker, in addition to all other legal remedies, shall have the right
to enforce this Agreement by a decree of specific performance.

     4.9  Survival of Option and Right of First Refusal.  In the event that
          ---------------------------------------------
this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to paragraph 4.5 because of
Broker's default, the option to purchase and right of first refusal conveyed
to Broker pursuant to Article V shall not survive such termination. Such
option and right of first refusal shall survive cancellation pursuant to
paragraph 4.3, any other termination other than pursuant to paragraph 4.5
because of Broker's default, or a transfer of control of Licensee or the
assignment of the Station's FCC authorizations to any party other than Broker
for a period of ten (10) years following such termination or the consummation
of such transfer or such assignment, and such option and right of first
refusal shall remain in full force and effect.

                     -----------------------------------

     5.1  Assignability.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
          -------------
be binding upon Licensee, Broker and their respective successors and assigns;
provided, however, that Licensee shall not assign or transfer its rights,
--------  -------
benefits, duties or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Broker, unless such assignment or transfer is to a single-purpose
corporation of which Licensee or Anthony J. Fant owns at least fifty percent
(50%), in value and voting power, of all issued and outstanding stock and
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.7, all such stock is pledged
to secure the obligations of  Licensee's successor under this Agreement.
This Agreement shall not terminate upon the sale of the Station to a successor
licensee or upon a transfer of control of Licensee, but shall be assigned to or
assumed by any subsequent owner of the Station.

     5.2  Option To Purchase.
          ------------------


                                      9
<PAGE>
 
     (a)  If and at such time as (i) Broker's acquisition of the Station
would not be prohibited by then existent FCC rules or policies and FCC action,
if any, allowing such acquisition shall no longer be subject to administrative
or judicial reconsideration or review, or (ii) Broker shall furnish evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Licensee that a waiver of the FCC's rules or
policies is likely to permit Broker to own the Station, Broker may, subject
to prior FCC approval, purchase the Station and all associated assets,
including real estate, from Licensee for a purchase price of Six Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($6,500,000.00) ("Exercise Price"), of which
Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) will be paid in cash at the closing
on the acquisition of the Station ("Station Closing"), plus discharge of
the balance, if any, of the obligations to Triplett & Associates, Inc. under
the Triplett Obligation defined in paragraph 4.7. The balance shall be paid
at the Station Closing in 175,000 shares of common stock of OCI, Broker's
corporate parent, at a guaranteed price of at least Twenty Dollars ($20.00)
per share based on the closing price on NASDAQ (or such other organized
exchange on which such shares shall be traded if such shares are not then
listed on NASDAQ) on the date preceding the closing on the exercised option
("Closing Price"). In the event that there are no trades of OCI stock on
that day, the Closing Price shall be the average of the low bid price and
the high ask price. If the Closing Price is less than Twenty Dollars ($20.00),
the difference shall be paid in cash in an amount equal to the product of
(a) 175,000 and (b) the difference between (x) Twenty Dollars ($20.00) and
(y) the Closing Price. If OCI's common stock is worth more than Twenty Dollars
($20.00) per share on such closing date, no adjustment shall be made in
the number of shares to be paid to Licensee. As consideration for this option
to purchase the Station, Broker shall pay to Licensee on the Commencement
Date the sum of Four Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($475,000.00)
("Option Payment") in cash, which Option Payment shall be credited against
the Exercise Price.

     (b)  During the first five (5) years following the Commencement Date,
Broker may exercise the option specified in this paragraph 5.2 by delivering
to Licensee a written notice of exercise no earlier than fifteen (15) days
following either of the events specified in (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this paragraph
5.2 and no later than two (2) years following either of the events specified
in (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this paragraph 5.2. During the remainder of the
term of this Agreement, as renewed, Broker may exercise the option specified
in this paragraph 5.2 by delivering to Licensee a written notice of exercise
no earlier than fifteen (15) days following either of the events specified
in (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this paragraph 5.2 and no later than one (1) year
following either of the events specified in (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this paragraph
5.2. Within thirty (30) days following delivery of such notice, Broker and
Licensee shall enter into a detailed asset purchase agreement with respect
to the Station, containing


                                      10
<PAGE>
 
customary and reasonable terms and conditions, and shall jointly file such
application or applications as may be required to obtain the consent of
the FCC for the assignment of the Station's license or licenses from Licensee
to Broker.

     (c)  Broker's rights under this option to purchase shall be fully
assignable to any third party (i) that is qualified under the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, and the FCC's rules and policies to hold the Station's
license, and (ii) that presents audited financial statements demonstrating
a net worth of at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for its preceding
fiscal year.

     (d) As used in paragraph 5.2(a), the term common stock shall mean and
include the common stock of OCI, authorized on the date hereof, and shall also
include any capital stock of any class of capital stock of OCI hereafter
authorized which shall not be limited to a fixed sum or percentage in respect of
the rights of the holders thereof to participate in dividends and in the
distribution of assets upon the voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of OCI, provided, however, that the shares issuable under this Agreement shall
include only shares of such class designated in OCI's Certificate of
Incorporation as common stock as of the date hereof, or (i) in the case of any
reclassification, change, consolidation, merger or conveyance of all or
substantially all of the assets of OCI, the securities or property received in
connection with such event, or (ii) in the case of any reclassification or
change in the outstanding shares of common stock of OCI as a result of
subdivision, or combination, or change in par value or from par value to no par
value or from no par value to par value such shares of common stock as so
reclassified or changed. In the event of the occurrence of any event described
in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) prior to the exercise by Broker of the
option included in paragraph 5.2(a) hereof, Licensee shall have the right upon
giving of notice to Broker within ten (10) days of the exercise of said option
by Broker of requiring Broker to pay the consideration due at the Station
Closing entirely in cash. Licensee acknowledges that it is the intention of
Licensee to acquire such shares of common stock to be issued in connection with
the exercise of the option by Broker for its own account for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to distribution or resale thereof. The
acquisition by Licensee of such shares shall constitute a confirmation by it of
this representation. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the shares of common
stock to be purchased by it will not have been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended and accordingly may not be sold unless they are sold in
a transaction which is exempt from the registration requirements of said Act or
a registration statement pursuant to that Act is in effect at the time of such
sale, and that each certificate representing such shares shall bear a legend to
that effect. Notwithstanding anything contained



                                      11
<PAGE>
 
herein, if, as a result of any merger, consolidation or sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of OCI, the then holders
of the common stock of OCI shall receive less than seventy-five
percent (75%) in total consideration in connection with such
transaction in common stock, as defined herein, of the purchaser 
or surviving entity, then Broker shall have the right to pay
Licensee upon the exercise of the option all in cash.

     5.3  Right of First Refusal.
          -----------------------

      (a)  In the event Licensee receives and wishes to accept a
bona fide offer to sell or transfer control of the Station,
---- ----
however, styled, with a party other than Broker, Licensee shall
provide Broker with written notice of that offer and all material
terms and conditions of that offer, including, without
limitation, the identity of the offering party.  If that offer is
evidenced by any writing(s), Licensee shall provide Broker with
true copies of such writings together with the written notice
required by this subparagraph.  Upon receipt of such notice,
Broker shall have the right, exercisable by giving notice in
writing thereof to Licensee within thirty (30) business days
after receipt of notice by Broker, to match such offer and, 
within thirty (30) days of such notice to Licensee, to enter into
an asset or stock purchase agreement with Licensee at the same
price and with equivalent material terms and conditions;
provided, however, that Broker's right to first refusal shall be
--------  -------
exercisable by Broker only if (i) Broker's acquisition of the
Station would not be prohibited by then existent FCC rules or
policies and FCC action, if any, allowing such acquisition
shall no longer be subject to administrative or judicial
reconsideration or review, or (ii) Broker shall, with its notice
matching the offer, furnish evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Licensee that a waiver of the FCC's rules is likely to permit
Broker to own the Station.

       (b)  Broker's rights under this right of first refusal shall
be fully assignable to any third party (i) that is qualified
under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the FCC's
rules and policies to hold the Station's license, and (ii) that
presents audited financial statements demonstrating a net worth
of at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for its
preceding fiscal year.

 
       5.4  Licensee's Option to Purchase Translator.   If and at
            ----------------------------------------
such time as the FCC amends Section 76.51 of its rules, 47 C.F.R.
(sections) 76.51, to delete Chillicothe from the name of the Columbus
television market, Licensee will consider exercising its option
under the Option Agreement dated October 7, 1993, among Broker;
RBC, Inc; and Triplett and Associates, Inc., to acquire the
assets associated with television translator W17AI, licensed to
Columbus, Ohio.  In the event of such acquisition, the operation


                                      12

 
<PAGE>
 
of television translator W17AI shall be subject to this 
Agreement.  At the time that Licensee exercises its option to
acquire W17AI, Broker agrees to enter into good faith
negotiations with Licensee to make the funds necessary for
acquisition of W17AI available by loan on an arms' length basis.
Such loan shall be secured by the assets associated with W17AI
and the personal guarantee of Anthony J. Fant.

                              REGULATORY MATTERS
                              -------------------

     6.1  Renegotiation Upon FCC or Other Regulatory
          ------------------------------------------
Changes.  If the FCC determines that this Agreement is
-------
inconsistent with Licensee's licensee obligations or is otherwise
contrary to FCC policies, rules and regulations, or if
regulatory, legislative, or judicial action subsequent to the
Commencement Date alters the permissibility of this Agreement
under the FCC's Rules or the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, the parties shall renegotiate this Agreement in good
faith and recast this Agreement in terms that are likely to cure
the defects perceived by the FCC or the changes caused by
regulatory, legislative, or judicial action and return a balance
of benefits to both parties comparable to the balance of benefits
provided by the Agreement in its current terms.  If, after such
good faith negotiations, either party determines that recasting
the Agreement to meet the defects perceived by the FCC is
impossible without materially changing the relationships
contemplated by the parties, either party may terminate this
Agreement without further liability upon thirty (30) days' prior
written notice.  If termination shall occur pursuant to this
paragraph, such termination shall extinguish and cancel this
Agreement without further liability on the part of either party
to the other; provided, however, that there shall be a final
              --------  -------
accounting of monies due but unpaid under this Agreement, and
provided further, that Broker shall be entitled to Liquidated
-------- -------
Damages, as defined in paragraph 4.6 herein.

     6.2  FCC Matters.
          -----------

     (a)  The parties agree that this Agreement shall be filed
with the FCC and placed in the public inspection file of the
Station; provided, however, that all monetary amounts shall be
         --------  -------
redacted from such publicly available copies.

     (b)  Should a change in FCC policy or rules make it
necessary to obtain FCC consent for the implementation,
continuation or further effectuation of any element of this
Agreement, both parties hereto shall use their best efforts
diligently to prepare, file and prosecute before the FCC all
petitions, waiver requests, construction permit applications,
amendments, rulemaking comments and other related documents


                                      13


<PAGE>
 
necessary to secure and/or retain FCC approval of all aspects of
this Agreement.  Broker and Licensee shall bear in equal measure
the reasonable cost of preparation of any such documents,
provided that each party has approved such expenditures.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
understood that no filing shall be made with the FCC with respect
to this Agreement unless both parties hereto have reviewed said
filing and consented to its submission.

     6.3   Mandatory Signal Carriage.  If the mandatory signal
           -------------------------
carriage rights of broadcasters set forth in Section 614 of the
Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,
47 U.S.C. (section) 534, or in the FCC's rules implementing such section
are legislatively, judicially, or administratively altered and
such alteration results in a reduction of the cable subscribers
receiving the Station's signal via their cable systems as of the
Station Closing compared to the number of such households on the
Commencement Date, the Exercise Price shall be reduced by an
amount which is the product of the following three numbers: (x)
the Exercise Price times (y) the percentage reduction in cable
subscribers times (z) fifty-eight percent (58%), which represents
the parties' approximation of cable penetration in the Columbus
ADI as of the date of this Agreement.  The parties agree that the
number of cable subscribers receiving the Station via their cable
systems on the Commencement Date is 291,166 as set forth in
Exhibit F.


                                 ARTICLE VII
                    BROADCAST EQUIPMENT AND RELATED ASSETS
                   ---------------------------------------

     7.1  Equipment and Assets.    Licensee represents and
          --------------------
warrants to Broker that Licensee owns the transmitting equipment
(including the Station's transmitter, antenna, transmission line,
and associated equipment), studio equipment, furniture, and
fixtures specified on the inventory attached hereto as Exhibit
B-1 (the "Tangible Assets").  Such Tangible Assets being crucial
to the successful operation of this Agreement, Licensee
represents and warrants to Broker that the Tangible Assets are
free and clear of all debts, liabilities, obligations, liens, and
encumbrances of any kind, character, and description, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, except for the liens
described in Exhibit G hereto.  Licensee affirmatively covenants
to Broker that the Tangible Assets shall not be disposed of
without the prior written consent of Broker, other than in the
ordinary course of business and unless such Tangible Assets shall
be replaced with assets of comparable quality, capacity, and
utility.

     7.2  Insurance.  The parties shall during the initial term
          _________
of this Agreement and during any and all Renewal Terms, keep in
force and effect by advance payment of premium comprehensive


                                      14

<PAGE>
 
casualty, property damage, business interruption, and liability
insurance with an insurance company and in an amount reasonably
acceptable to Broker, insuring against any liability that may
accrue on account of any loss or damages to the Tangible Assets or
occurrences on or about the Tangible Assets.  Broker and Licensee
shall be specified as insureds under the policy required under
this Section 7.2  Licensee will supply a Certificate of
Insurance to Broker demonstrating Licensee's compliance with its
obligations under this Section 7.2 on the Commencement Date and
upon each and every renewal date for the insurance policy
maintained by Licensee, and will provide Broker thirty (30) days'
prior notice of the expiration of said policy and immediate
notice of any cancellation of said policy.

     7.3  Lease of Tower Space and Equipment Building
          -------------------------------------------

         (a)  Licensee is the lessee under that certain lease of
land on which is located a tower of Licensee and an equipment
building with Donald L. Davis and Wilma J. Davis ("Davises")
which expires July 31, 1998, as amended (the "Tower
Lease").  Such Tower Lease being crucial to the successful 
operation of this Agreement, Licensee represents and warrants to
Broker that (a) Licensee has delivered to Broker a complete and
current copy of the Tower Lease; (b) the Tower Lease is and will
remain in full force and effect; and (c) Licensee is and will
remain in material compliance with the terms of the Tower Lease,
including its insurance requirements, and Licensee is not in
breach of any term of the Tower Lease.

         (b)  Licensee affirmatively covenants to Broker that 
Licensee will timely pay all rental payments under the Tower
Lease promptly when due and otherwise fully comply with all terms
of the Tower Lease, and that Licensee will provide copies of any
and all notices received from the Davises relating to the Tower
Lease within seventy-two (72) hours of their receipt by Licensee.

         (c)  Except as provided above in paragraph 5.1 with
respect to Licensee's assignment or transfer of its rights under
this Agreement to a controlled corporation, Licensee agrees not
to assign the Tower Lease without the consent of Broker, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  A request by
Licensee for the consent of Broker to assign the Tower Lease
shall be deemed reasonable if such assignment is associated with
the assignment of the license of the Station or the transfer of
control of Licensee for which the FCC's consent is necessary.

         (d)  Licensee agrees to exercise its right to extend
the Tower Lease for the duration of each Renewal Term commencing
during the term of this Agreement as of and to the extent
provided in the Tower Lease.

equity, no arbitration proceeding, and no proceeding before or by
any court, commission, agency, or other administrative or

knowledge, threatened or anticipated, which would have a 
material adverse affect upon the Station.  To the extent that any
such event shall exist on the Commencement Date, Licensee agrees
that any and all costs, judgments, and liabilities which have or
shall become due and payable shall be the sole and exclusive
financial responsibility of Licensee and shall be deducted from
Licensee's share of Net Operating Cash Income, as defined in

                               LEASE AGREEMENT

     Lease Agreement made this     day of             ,  19    between the
                              -----      -------------     --
Lessor and Lessee set forth at Schedule A, attached hereto.
                               ----------

     1.  Lease Agreement. Lessor hereby leases to Lessee, and Lessee hereby
rents from Lessor, all the machinery, equipment and other personal property
("Equipment") described in the Equipment Lease Schedule(s) which is attached
hereto ("Schedules"), upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease,
as supplemented by the terms and conditions set forth in the appropriate
Schedule identifying such items of Equipment. All of the terms and conditions
of this Lease shall govern the rights and obligations of Lessor and Lessee,
except as specifically modified in writing. Whenever reference is made herein
to "this Lease", it shall be deemed to include each of the various Schedules
identifying all items of Equipment, all of which constitute one undivided
lease of the Equipment and the terms and conditions of which are incorporated
herein by reference.

     2.  Term. The obligations under this Lease shall commence upon the
written acceptance thereof by Lessor and shall end upon full performance
and observance of each and every term, condition and covenant set forth
in this Lease, each Schedule thereto and any extensions thereof. The rental
term of the Equipment listed in each Schedule shall commence on the date
that the first rental payment is due and shall terminate on the date set
forth at Schedule A.
         ----------

     3.  Rental Payments.  The rent for the Equipment described in each
Schedule shall be the amount stated in such Schedule and shall be due and
payable on the dates set forth therein. Such rent shall be payable at the
office of Lessor or its assigns (or at such other place as Lessor may from
time to time designate in writing). The receipt of any check or other item
on account of any rental payment shall not be considered as payment thereof
until such check or other item is honored when presented for payment.

     4.  Delivery and Installation. Lessee has selected each item of Equipment
designated in the appropriate Schedule. If Equipment is to be ordered by
Lessor, in reliance upon Lessee's selection, such Equipment will then be
ordered by Lessor from such supplier or Lessor will accept an assignment
of any existing purchase order therefor. Lessor shall have no liability
for any delivery or failure by the supplier to fill the purchase order or

                                  Exhibit A
<PAGE>
 
meet the conditions thereof. Lessee, at its expense, shall pay all
transportation, packing, taxes, duties, installation, testing and other
charges in connection with the delivery, installation and use of the Equipment.
In the event that the cost of any item of Equipment described in a particular
Schedule is higher or lower than the price set forth in Lessor's purchase
order therefor, then the monthly rental shall be changed accordingly to
fully reflect any such adjustment.

     5.  Warranties.  LESSOR, NOT BEING THE MANUFACTURER OF THE EQUIPMENT
NOR THE MANUFACTURER'S AGENT, MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO: THE MERCHANTABILITY OF THE EQUIPMENT OR ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE; THE DESIGN OR CONDITION OF THE EQUIPMENT; THE QUALITY OR CAPACITY
OF THE EQUIPMENT, THE WORKMANSHIP IN THE EQUIPMENT; COMPLIANCE OF THE EQUIPMENT
WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY LAW, RULE, SPECIFICATION OR CONTRACT PERTAINING
THERETO; PATENT INFRINGEMENT; OR LATENT DEFECTS. Lessee will be subrogated
to Lessor's claims, if any, against the manufacturer or supplier of the
Equipment for breach of any warranty or representation and, upon written
request from Lessee, Lessor shall take all reasonable action requested by
Lessee to enforce any such warranty, express or implied, issued on or
applicable to any of the Equipment which is enforceable by Lessor in its own
name; provided, however, that (a) Lessee is not in default under this Lease and
      -----------------
(b) Lessor shall not be obligated to resort to litigation to enforce any such
warranty unless Lessee shall pay all expenses in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee's obligations to pay the rentals or
otherwise under this Lease shall be and are absolute and unconditional. All
proceeds of any such warranty recovery from the manufacturer or supplier of the
Equipment shall first be used to repair the affected Equipment.

     6.  Title To and Location of Equipment.  Title to each item of Equipment
leased hereunder shall remain with the Lessor at all times and the Lessee
shall have no right, title or interest therein, except as expressly set
forth in this Lease. Lessee, at is expense, shall protect and defend Lessor's
title to the Equipment and shall keep the Equipment free and clear from any
and all claims, liens, encumbrances and legal processes of Lessee's creditors
and other persons. Lessor assumes no liability and makes no representation
as to the treatment by Lessee of this Lease, the Equipment or the rental
payments for financial statement or tax purposes.

     All items of Equipment shall at all times be and remain personal property
notwithstanding that any such Equipment may now

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
or hereafter be affixed to realty. The Equipment shall be delivered to the
location specified in the Schedule with respect thereto and shall not thereafter
be removed from such location without the written consent of Lessor. The
Lessor shall be permitted to display notice of its ownership of the Equipment
by affixing to each item of Equipment an identifying stencil or plate or
any other indicia of ownership and Lessee shall not alter, deface, cover
or remove such ownership identification.

     7.  Use of Equipment, Inspection and Reports. Lessee may possess and use
the Equipment in accordance with this Lease, provided that any such use
is in conformity with all applicable laws, any insurance policies and any
warranties of the manufacturer with respect to the Equipment. Lessor shall
have the right to inspect the Equipment at the premises of the Lessee or
wherever the Equipment may be located. Lessee shall promptly notify Lessor
of all details arising out of any change in location of the Equipment, any
alleged encumbrances thereon or any accident allegedly resulting from the
use or operation thereof.

    8.  Further Assurances.  Lessee shall execute and deliver to Lessor,
upon Lessor's request, such instruments and assurances as Lessor deems
necessary for the confirmation or perfection of this Lease and Lessor's
rights hereunder. In furtherance thereof, Lessor may file or record this
Lease or a financing statement with respect thereto so as to give notice
to any interested parties. Any such filing or recording shall not be deemed
evidence of any intent to create a security interest under the Uniform
Commercial Code.

     9.  Risk of Loss.  All risk of loss, damage, theft or destruction to
each item of Equipment shall be borne by the Lessee. No such loss, damage,
theft or destruction of the Equipment, in whole or in part, shall impair
the obligations of Lessee under this Lease, all of which shall continue
in full force and effect; and Lessee, at Lessor's option, shall either
(a) place the affected Equipment in good repair, condition and working order,
or (b) replace the same with like Equipment in good repair, condition and
working order, or (c) pay the Lessor an amount equal to all unpaid rent
due and to become due under this Lease with respect to the affected Equipment,
less the net amount of the recovery, if any, actually received by Lessor
from insurance or otherwise for such loss, damage, theft or destruction.
After compliance with the foregoing to Lessor's satisfaction, and provided
Lessee is not in default under this Lease, Lessee shall be subrogated to
Lessor's rights with respect to any insurance policies or claims for
reimbursement by others with respect to such loss, damage, theft or destruction.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
     10.  Maintenance and Repairs.  Lessee shall, at its expense, maintain
each item of Equipment, and all additions, attachments and accessories with
respect thereto, in good mechanical condition and running order, but shall
not be responsible for normal wear and tear or depreciation resulting from the
authorized use thereof. Without the prior written consent of Lessor, Lessee
shall make no repair, alteration or attachment with respect to any item
of Equipment which interferes with the normal and satisfactory operation
or maintenance thereof, or creates a safety hazard, or which might result
in the creation of a mechanic's or materialman's lien with respect thereto.
All additions, attachments, accessories and repairs at any time made or
placed upon the Equipment shall become part of the Equipment and shall be
the property of Lessor

     11.  Insurance.  Lessee will, at its own expense, insure the Equipment
at all times against all hazards requested by Lessor, including but not
limited to fire, theft and extended coverage insurance, and such policies shall
be payable to Lessor as its interest may appear. Such policies of insurance
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lessor as to form, amount and insurer,
and shall provide for at least ten (10) days written notice of cancellation
to Lessor. Lessee shall furnish certificates, policies or endorsements to
Lessor as proof of such insurance. Lessor may act as attorney for Lessee
in making, adjusting or settling any claims under any insurance policies
insuring the Equipment. Lessee assigns to Lessor all of its right, title and
interest to any insurance policies insuring the Equipment, including but not
limited to all rights to receive the proceeds of insurance not in excess of the
unpaid obligations under this Lease, and directs any insurer to pay all such
proceeds directly to Lessor and authorizes Lessor to endorse Lessee's name on
any draft for such proceeds.

     Lessee shall, at its expense, carry public liability insurance with
respect to the Equipment and the use thereof, in such amounts and with such
insurers as are reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, and such insurance policies
shall also name Lessor as an insured thereunder. The proceeds of any public
liability or property damage insurance shall be payable first to Lessor
to the extent of its liability, if any, and the balance to Lessee. The proceeds
of any fire, theft and extended coverage insurance with respect to the Equipment
shall be payable solely to Lessor and shall be applied by Lessor toward
the payment of Lessee's obligations hereunder and any balance of the proceeds
shall be the property of Lessor, provided that at Lessor's option such proceeds
may be used for the repair or replacement of the affected Equipment.

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
    12.  Taxes.  Lessee shall keep the Equipment free and clear of all levies,
liens and encumbrances and, as additional rent during the term of this Lease,
shall pay all assessments, license fees, taxes (including sales, use, excise,
personal property, ad valorem, stamp, documentary and other taxes) and all
other governmental charges, fees, fines or penalties whatsoever, whether
payable by Lessor or Lessee, on or relating to the Equipment or the use,
registration, rental, shipment, transportation, delivery, ownership or
operation thereof, and on or relating to this Lease and any Schedules and
Lessee shall file all returns required therefor and furnish copies thereof
to Lessor at its request; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
                          --------  -------
include any federal or state income or franchise taxes or Lessor.

    13.  Lessor's Performance of Lessee's Obligations. If Lessee shall fail
to duly and promptly perform any of its obligations under this Lease with
respect to the Equipment, Lessor may (at its option) perform any act of
make any payment which Lessor deems necessary for the maintenance and
preservation of the Equipment and Lessor's title thereto, including payments
for satisfaction of liens, repairs, taxes, levies and insurance. All sums
so paid or incurred by Lessor, together with interest as provided below,
and any reasonable legal fees incurred by Lessor in connection therewith
shall be additional rent under this Lease and payable by Lessee to Lessor
on demand. The performance of any act or payment by Lessor as aforesaid
shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any obligation or default on
the part of Lessee.

    14.  Late Charges.  Should Lessee fail to duly pay any part of any rental
payment or other sum to be paid to Lessor under this Lease, then Lessee
shall pay interest on such delinquent payment from the due date until paid
at the lower of 1% per month or the highest legal contract rate of interest.

    15.  Indemnification.  Lessee assumes liability for, and hereby agrees
to indemnify, protect and keep harmless Lessor, its agents, employees,
officers, directors, successors and assigns from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses damages, injuries, claims, demands, penalties,
actions, costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's
fees, of whatsoever kind and nature, arising out of the use, condition
(including but not limited to latent and other defects and whether or not
discoverable by Lessee or Lessor), operation, ownership, selection, delivery,
leasing or return of any item of Equipment, regardless of where, how and by whom
operated, or any failure on the part of the Lessee to perform or comply
with any conditions of this Lease. The indemnities and assumptions of



                                     -5-
<PAGE>
 
liabilities and obligations herein provided for shall continue in full force
and effect notwithstanding the expiration or other termination of this Lease.
Lessee is an independent contractor and nothing contained in this Lease
shall authorize Lessee or any other person to operate any item of Equipment
so as to incur or impose any liability or obligation for or on behalf of
Lessor.

    16.  No Offset.  This Lease is a net lease and all rental payments shall
be paid by Lessee irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which Lessee may have against Lessor, the supplier
of the Equipment or any other party.

    17.  Purchase Option.  Lessee shall have no option to purchase or otherwise
acquire title or ownership of any item of Equipment.

    18.  Renewal.   There shall be no renewal of this Lease without the
written agreement of Lessor. If Lessor fails to return any item of Equipment
at the end of the original lease term or any renewal thereof, then (without
an waiver or Lessor's rights) the Lease thereof shall automatically be renewed
from month to month with rent payable monthly at the monthly rate applicable
during the original term.

    19.  Advance Rentals and Security.  Any advance rentals paid by Lessee
to Lessor shall be applied to rental payments coming due under this Lease
in the inverse order of maturity. Lessee's obligations under this Lease
are secured by any of its property with respect to which Lessor may be granted
a security interest in any other agreement or document.

    20.  Assignment by Lessee.  Without Lessor's prior written consent,
Lessee may not, by operation of law or otherwise, (a) assign, transfer,
pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Lease or any interest therein
or (b) sublet or lend the Equipment or permit same to be used by anyone
other than Lessee or Lessee's employees.

    21.  Assignment by Lessee.  For the purpose of providing funds for
financing the purchase of the Equipment, or for any other purpose, Lessee
agrees (a) that Lessor may assign, sell or encumber all or any other part
of this Lease, the Equipment and the rental payments hereunder and (b) in
the event of any such assignment of rental payments hereunder and written
notice thereof to Lessee, to unconditionally pay directly to any such assignee
all rentals and other sums due or to become due under this Lease. THE RIGHTS
OF ANY SUCH ASSIGNEE SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY DEFENSE, COUNTERCLAIM OR
SETOFF WHICH LESSEE MAY HAVE


                                     -6-
<PAGE>
 
AGAINST THE LESSOR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such assignment (a)
shall be subject to Lessee's right to possess and use the Equipment so long
as Lessee is not in default under this Lease and (b) shall not release any
of Lessor's obligations hereunder or any claim which Lessee has against
Lessor.

    22.  Return of Equipment. Upon payment in full of all rental payments
for any item of Equipment described in any Schedule, Lessee shall at its
expense deliver such items of Equipment to Lessor's premises set forth at
Schedule A or any place or places within a radius of 100 miles of Lessor's
----------
premises, designated by Lessor in writing, for such disposition as Lessor
may determine. In the event of default by Lessee under this Lease, Lessee
shall return all Equipment to Lessor in the same manner. All Equipment so
delivered by Lessee to Lessor shall be in the same condition as when delivered
to Lessor, reasonable wear and tear resulting from authorized use thereof
alone expected.

    23.  Events of Default.  Lessee shall be in default under this Lease
upon the happening of any of the following events or conditions ("Events
of Default"):

         (a)  Default by Lessee in payment of any installment or any rent
other indebtedness or obligation now or hereafter owed by Lessee to Lessor
under this Lease or otherwise and the continuance of such default for ten (10)
consecutive days; or (b) default in the performance of any obligation, covenant
or liability contained in this Lease or any other agreement or document with
Lessor, and the continuance of such default for ten (10) consecutive days after
written notice thereof by Lessor to Lessee; or (c) any warranty, representation
or statement made or furnished to Lessor by or on behalf of Lessee proves to
have been false in any material respect when made or furnished; or (d) loss,
theft, damage, destruction or the attempted sale or encumbrance by Lessee of any
of the Equipment, or the making of any levy, seizure or attachment thereof or
thereon; or (e) dissolution, termination of existence, discontinuance of its
business, insolvency, business failure, or appointment of a receiver or any part
of the property of, or assignment for the benefit or creditors by Lessee or the
commencement of any proceedings under any bankruptcy, reorganization or
arrangement laws by or against Lessee.

    24.  Remedies of Lessee.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
and at any time thereafter (subject to any applicable grace provisions),
Lessor may without any further notice exercise one or more of the following
remedies, as Lessor in its sole discretion shall elect: (a) declare all
unpaid rentals under this Lease to be immediately due and payable; (b)
terminate this Lease



                                     -7-
<PAGE>
 
as to any or all items of Equipment; (c) take possession of the Equipment
wherever found, and for this purpose enter upon any premises of Lessee and
remove the Equipment, without any liability for suit, action or other
proceeding by the Lessee and remove the same; (d) cause Lessee at its expense
to promptly return the Equipment to Lessor and in the condition set forth
above; (e) use, hold, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the Equipment
or any item thereof on the premises of Lessee or any other location without
affecting the obligations of Lessee as provided in this Lease; (f) sell
or lease the Equipment or any part thereof, at public auction or by private
sale or lease at such time or times and upon such terms as Lessor may
determine, free and clear of any rights of Lessee and, if notice thereof
is required by law, any notice in writing of any such sale or lease by Lessor
to Lessee not less than ten (10) days prior to the date thereof shall
constitute reasonable notice thereof to Lessee; (g) proceed appropriate
action either by law or in equity to enforce performance by Lessee of the
applicable covenants of this Lease or to recover damages for the breach
thereof; or (h) exercise any and all rights accruing to a Lessor under any
applicable law upon a default by a Lessee. In addition, Lessor shall be
entitled to recover immediately as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty,
a sum equal to the aggregate of the following: (a) all unpaid rentals or
other sums which are due and payable for any items of Equipment up to the
date of redelivery to or repossession by Lessor; (b) any expenses paid or
incurred by Lessor in connection with the repossession, holding, repair
and subsequent sale, lease or other disposition of the Equipment, including
but not limited to attorney's fees and legal expenses; (c) all unpaid rentals
due and to become due under this Lease for any item of Equipment which Lessee
fails to return to Lessor as provided above or converts or destroys, or
which Lessor is unable to repossess; and (d) an amount equal to the difference
between (i) all unpaid rentals for any item of Equipment returned to or
repossessed by Lessor from the date thereof to the end of the respective
rental period therefor and (ii) the present fair market rental value of
each such item or item of Equipment for such unexpired rental period (the
"Unexpired Rental Value"); provided, however, that the Unexpired Rental
                           --------  -------
Value of each item of Equipment shall be deemed to be an amount equal to
the proceeds of any sale thereof by Lessor or lease thereof by Lessor for
a period substantially similar to the unexpired rental period therefor.
Should Lessor, however estimate its actual damages to exceed the foregoing,
Lessor may, at its option, recover its actual damages in lieu of or in
addition thereto. Lessor shall not be obligated to sell, lease or otherwise
dispose of any item or repossessed Equipment hereunder if it would impair
the sale, lease or other disposition of similar equipment in the ordinary
course of Lessor's business or which was previously repossessed


                                     -8-
<PAGE>
 
by Lessor from any party. None of the remedies under this Lease are intended
to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other
remedy referred to herein or otherwise available to Lessor in law or in
equity. Any repossession or subsequent sale or lease by Lessor of any item
of Equipment shall not bar an action for a deficiency as herein provided
and the bringing of an action or the entry of judgement against the Lessee
shall not bar the Lessor's right to repossess any or all items of Equipment.
LESSEE WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO NOTICE AND TO A JUDICIAL HEARING WITH
RESPECT TO THE REPOSSESSION OF THE EQUIPMENT BY LESSOR IN THE EVENT OF
A DEFAULT HEREUNDER BY LESSEE.


    25.  Severability.  Any provision of this Lease which is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
in effective to the extent of such prohibition and unenforceable, without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, Lessee hereby waivers any provision of law which prohibits
or renders unenforceable any provisions hereof in any respect.

    26.  Notices.  All notices, reports, and other documents provided for
herein shall be deemed to have been given or made when mailed, postage prepaid,
or sent by telefacsimile, addressed to Lessor or Lessee at their respective
addresses set forth above at Schedule A or such other addresses as either
                             ----------
of the parties hereto may designate in writing to the other from time to
time for such purpose.

    27.  Amendment and Waivers.  This instrument and Schedule A and the
                                                     ----------
Schedules attached hereto constitute the entire agreement between Lessor
---------
and Lessee with respect to the Equipment and the subject matter of this
Lease. No term or provision of this Lease may be changed, waived, amended
or terminated, except by a written agreement signed by both Lessor and Lessee,
except that Lessor may insert the serial number of any item of Equipment
on the appropriate Schedule after delivery thereof. No express or implied
waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default hereunder shall in any way be,
or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Event of Default
whether similar in kind or otherwise.

    28.  Construction.  This Lease shall in all respects be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. The titles
of the sections of this Lease are for convenience only and shall not define
or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof. Time is of the essence of
this Lease in each and all of its provisions.

LEASE AND THAT IT IS NON-CANCELLABLE FOR THE ORIGINAL RENTAL TERM.

<PAGE>
 
period, the difference shall be deducted from the next Station Operating
Expense Estimated Payment thereafter made by Broker pursuant to this Agreement.
If the amount shown on such statement shall be greater than the Station
Operating Expense Payment made by Broker for such period, then Broker shall

index reflecting changes in the cost of living determined in a similar manner
or by substitution, combination or weighting of available indices, expenditure
groups, items, components or population, published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics or by a responsible financial periodical or recognized authority
shall be designated by Broker to be the Price Index thereafter.  The Price
Index for any date relevant to the application of any provision hereof shall
be that published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month containing
such date, if computed for such month, or otherwise for the most recent
month immediately preceding the month for which the application is to be
made.  Since a Price Index relevant to the application of the provisions
hereof may not be available as of the date on which a determination using
the Consumer Price Index is to be made, necessary adjustments between Licensee
and Broker shall be made retroactively, within a reasonable time after required
computations can be readily completed.
 
     3.  Monthly Payments by Broker.  Commencing on the Initial Calculation
         ---------------------------
Date for the portion of the calendar month then remaining and thereafter
monthly within five days of the first business day of each month thereafter
during the term of this Agreement, Broker shall pay to Licensee the sum
of (a) the Debt Service Payment, (b) the Operating Lease Payment and (c)
the


                                      -9-
<PAGE>
 
Station Operating Expense Estimated Payment for such month, subject, however,
to reduction in the case of the Station Operating Expense Estimated Payment
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Schedule B.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, in the event (i) Broker
shall receive notice of default from the holder of debt of Licensee secured
by a first mortgage on the property of Licensee, (ii) Broker shall thereafter
send a copy of such notice to Licensee, and (iii) Licensee shall not contest
such notice by commencement of legal proceedings within ten (10) days of
the sending of such notice by Broker, Broker may thereafter make all or
part of the Debt Service Payment to the holder to the extent of Licensee's
obligation at such time to such holder.
 
     4.  Payments to Licensee. Within sixty days after the First Interim
         --------------------
Calculation Date, and each Interim Calculation Date thereafter, or the Final
Calculation Date, whichever shall occur first, Broker shall make a
determination of the Net Operating Income in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement for the Accounting Period ending on such Interim or Final
Calculation Date and shall submit the determination to Licensee. With such
schedule, Broker shall pay to Licensee with respect to such Accounting Period
the sum, if any, of (a) 25 percent of the Net Operating Income of $1 million
or less, (b) 30 percent of the Net Operating Income in excess of $1 million

<PAGE>
 
million, (c) 35 percent of the Net Operating Income in excess of $2 million
but not more than $3 million, (d) 40 percent of the Net Operating Income
in excess of $3 million but not more than $4 million, (e) 45 percent of
the Net Operating Income in excess of $4 million but not more than $5 million
and (f) 50 percent of the Net Operating Income in excess of $5 million.
 
     5.  Accounting. Within 30 days of the time of the rendering of any
         ----------
statement of Station Operating Expenses or Net Operating Income (a "Statement")
required under this Agreement, if either party shall question the amount
or propriety of any item appearing in such Statement or excluded therefrom
and if thereafter Broker and Licensee cannot agree as to the amount or
propriety of such item, the dispute may be determined by arbitration as
hereinafter provided.  Notice of arbitration shall be given within seventy-five
days of the delivery of the Statement, unless a party has elected to audit
as hereinafter provided.  Notwithstanding that a party may question any
item, the amount due as shown on such Statement shall nevertheless be paid
(except for the portion if any which is then subject to ongoing arbitration
or litigation).  Unless a party shall take written exception to any item
contained in any such Statement within 30 days after delivery of the same,
such Statement shall be considered as final and accepted by the party to
whom delivered.  Either party will upon request by the other within 45


                                     -11-
<PAGE>
 
days make available for inspection books of original entry and documentation
relating to any of the items of income or expense reflected in any such
Statement.  Each party shall have the right at its sole cost and expense
to audit any such Statement.  Written notice of intention to audit shall
be received by the other party within 45 days of the furnishing of any
Statement.  Said audit shall be commenced within 30 days of the delivery
of notice of intention and once commenced must be pursued until completed
at the office of the party which is subject to the audit during the hours
of 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. during the normal business work week.  Results
of each audit shall be made available to all parties.  In the event of a
discrepancy resulting in underpayment or overpayment of more than 5 percent
of that which was actually paid, the party subject to the audit shall pay
the cost thereof.  In any other event, the party requesting the audit shall pay
the cost.  Should the parties be unable to reconcile the amount contained
in any such audit, either party shall have the right to elect to arbitrate
such dispute provided it gives written notice of its election to arbitrate
within 30 days of the date after delivery of the audit results.  The failure
to give written notice within such 30 day period shall be deemed a waiver
of any right to arbitrate the amounts disclosed on the audit.  If as a result
of the audit there shall be any adjustments with respect to any amounts
due or heretofore paid pursuant to this agreement, such amount shall be


                                     -12-
<PAGE>
 
paid within 10 days.  If such amount is not paid within 10 days, it shall
bear interest at the maximum rate permitted by law.  All arbitration
proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association and shall be held in Columbus,
Ohio.  In any proceeding, the arbitrators shall be bound by the provisions
of this Agreement.  The prevailing party in any arbitration proceeding shall
be entitled to enforce such award in any court of competent jurisdiction.

<PAGE>
 
        A. The non-payment, when due, of any amount payable under, or the
    failure to perform, any of the Obligations or any extension or renewal
    thereof;

        B. Any statement, representation or warranty of the Debtor herein, in
    the Time Brokerage Agreement or in any other writing at any time furnished
    by the Debtor to the Secured Party is untrue in any respect as of the date
    made;

        C. Any obligor, which term is used herein shall mean the Debtor and
    such other party primarily or secondarily liable on any of the liabilities,
    becomes insolvent or unable to pay debts as they mature or makes an
    assignment for the benefit of creditors, conveys any assets to a trustee
    for the benefit of the obligor's creditors, conveys substantially all of
    its assets, or any proceeding is instituted by or against the obligor
    alleging that such obligor is insolvent or unable to pay debts as they
    mature or a petition of any kind is filed under the Federal Bankruptcy Act
    by or against such obligor.

        D. Entry of any judgment against the Debtor or order of attachment,

Debtor agrees in case of default to assemble, at its expense, all the
collateral at a convenient place acceptable to the Secured Party and to pay all
costs to the Secured Party of collection and enforcement of the Obligations,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses,
including, without limitation, participation in bankruptcy proceedings and
expenses of locating the collateral and expenses of any repairs to any property
to which any collateral may be affixed or be a part. If any notification of any
intended disposition of any of the collateral is required by law, such
notification, if mailed, shall be deemed reasonable and properly given if sent
at least five (5) days before such disposition, postage prepaid, addressed to
the Debtor at the address herein shown or at such other address as the Debtor
may have given to the Secured Party. Debtor agrees that Secured Party shall, in
the event of any default, have the right to peaceably retake any of the


                                      -6-
<PAGE>
 
collateral, and Debtor waives any right they may have, in such instance to a
judicial hearing prior to such retaking.

    10. FCC APPROVAL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
        ------------
this Agreement, the Secured Party will not take any action pursuant to this
Agreement which would constitute or result in any assignment of license or
change of control of the Debtor, if such assignment of license or change of
control would require (under then-existing law) prior approval of the FCC
without first obtaining such prior approval. After a default has occurred and is
continuing, the Debtor agrees to take any and all actions that the Secured
Party may reasonably request in order to obtain any FCC approvals which are
necessary or appropriate to enable the Secured Party to exercise and fully
enjoy all rights and benefits granted to the Secured Party by this Agreement,
including specifically, without limitation, the use of the Debtor's reasonable
efforts, at the Debtor's cost and expense, to assist the Secured Party in
obtaining any prior approvals from the FCC as are necessary for performance of
any action or transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Specifically, and
without limitation, the Debtor will, after a default has occurred and is
continuing, and upon the Secured Party's request, prepare, sign and file with
the FCC all relevant portions of any application for assignment of license or
transfer of control as may be necessary or appropriate under FCC rules and
regulations.

    11. GENERAL. Time shall be deemed of the very essence of this agreement.
        -------
Except as otherwise defined in this agreement all terms in this agreement shall
have the meanings provided by the Ohio Uniform Commercial Code. Secured Party
shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and
preservation of any collateral in its possession if it takes such action for
that purpose as Debtor requests in writing, but failure of Secured Party to
comply with such request shall not of itself be deemed a failure to exercise
reasonable care, and failure of the Secured Party to preserve or protect any
rights with respect to such collateral against any prior parties or to do any
act with respect to the preservation of such collateral not so requested by
Debtor shall not be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care in the custody
and preservation of such collateral. Any delay on the part of Secured Party in
exercising any power, privilege or right hereunder, or under any other
instrument executed by Debtor to Secured Party in connection herewith shall not
operate as a waiver thereof and no single or partial exercise thereof, or the
exercise of any other power, privilege or right shall preclude other or further
exercises thereof, or the exercise of any other power, privilege or right. The
waiver by Secured Party of any default by Debtor shall not constitute a waiver
of any subsequent defaults, but shall be restricted to the defaults so waived.
If any part of this agreement shall be contrary to law which Secured Party
might seek to apply or enforce, or should otherwise be defective, the other
provisions of this agreement shall not be affected thereby, but shall


                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
continue in full force and effect. All rights, remedies and powers of Secured
Party hereunder are irrevocable and cumulative, and not alternative or
exclusive, and shall be in addition to all rights, remedies and powers given
hereunder or in or by any other instruments or by the Ohio Uniform Commercial
Code or any laws now existing or hereafter enacted.

    This Agreement has been executed and delivered in Ohio and shall be
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. Whenever possible
each provision of this agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this
Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or other remaining
provisions of this Agreement. The rights and privileges of Secured Party
hereunder shall inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns and this
agreement shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Debtor.

    Debtor hereby authorizes the Secured Party to date and correct obvious
errors in this Agreement without affecting Debtor's liability hereunder.

    The Debtor acknowledges that this is the entire agreement between the
parties except to the extent that writings signed by the party to be charged
are specifically incorporated herein by reference either in this Agreement or
in such writings and acknowledges receipt of a true and complete copy of this
Agreement.

                                   GUARANTY

   THIS GUARANTY, dated as of dated as of the     day of March, 1994, is
                                              ---
by Anthony J. Fant, of Birmingham, Alabama, (the "Guarantor") in favor of 
Outlet Broadcasting, Inc. ("Outlet").

   WHEREAS, Fant Broadcasting Company of Ohio, Inc. ("FB Inc.") owns television 
station WWAT-TV and has entered in a Time Brokerage Agreement, dated this date, 
with Outlet (the "Agreement");

   WHEREAS, The Guarantor owns all of the shares of the outstanding capital
stock of FB Inc. and the execution and delivery by the Guarantor of this
Guaranty is a condition precedent to, and an inducement for, Outlet's execution
and delivery of the Agreement; and

   WHEREAS, the Guarantor expects to derive substantial benefits from FB
Inc. as a result of the Agreement;

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Guarantor hereby represents and agrees as follows:

   1.   GUARANTY OF PERFORMANCE.  The Guarantor hereby guarantees to Outlet
the full and punctual performance when due (including but not limited to
payment) of all liabilities, agreements and other obligations of FB Inc.
to Outlet, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to
become due, secured or unsecured, now existing or hereafter arising or
acquired, relating to or arising out of or under the Agreement (collectively,
the "Obligations").  This Guaranty is an irrevocable, absolute, unconditional
and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual performance of the Obligations
and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that Outlet first attempt
to resort to any other means of obtaining payment or performance.  In the
event that an Event of Default (as such term is defined in Section 8, below)
                                                           ---------
shall have occurred, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall become
immediately due, without demand or notice of any nature, all of which are
expressly waived by the Guarantor.  Performance by the Guarantor hereunder
may be required by Outlet on any number of occasions.

   2.   GUARANTOR AGREEMENT TO PAY. The Guarantor further agrees to pay
to Outlet, on demand, all costs and expenses (including court costs and
legal fees and expenses) incurred or expended by Outlet in connection with
this Guaranty and the enforcement

<PAGE>
 
thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this from the
time of notice by Outlet to Guarantor that such amounts are due until payment,
at the rate per annum equal to 12%, provided that if such interest exceeds
the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law, then such
interest shall be reduced to such maximum permitted amount.

   3.   LIMITED GUARANTY.  The liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall
be limited in recourse to Guarantor's rights, title and interests in the
capital stock of FB Inc.

   4.   WAIVERS BY GUARANTOR; HOLDER'S FREEDOM TO ACT.  The Guarantor agrees
that the Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with
their respective terms regardless of any law, regulation or order now or
hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of Outlet with respect thereto.  The Guarantor waives presentment,
demand, protest, notice of acceptance, notice of Obligations incurred and
all other notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue
of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter
in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of FB Inc., and
all suretyship defenses generally.

   5.   UNENFORCEABILITY OF OBLIGATIONS.  If for any reason FB Inc. ceases
to have any legal existence or has no legal obligation to discharge any
of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become irrecoverable
from FB Inc. by operation of law or for any other reason, this Guaranty
shall nevertheless be binding on the Guarantor to the same extent as if
the Guarantor at all times had been the principal obligor on all such
Obligations.

   6.   SUBROGATION AND SUBORDINATION.  Until the performance in full of
all Obligations and any and all obligations of FB Inc. to Outlet (and the
expiration of any applicable preference periods under the Federal Bankruptcy
Code without there having occurred any reorganization), the Guarantor shall
not exercise any rights against FB Inc. arising as a result of any payment
by the Guarantor hereunder, by way of subrogation or otherwise, and will
not prove any claim in competition with Outlet or its affiliates in respect
of any payment hereunder in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of any
nature; the Guarantor will not claim any set-off or counterclaim against
FB Inc. in respect of any liability of the Guarantor to FB Inc.; and the
Guarantor waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral
which may be held by Outlet or any such affiliate.  The payment of any amounts
due with respect to any indebtedness of FB Inc. now or hereafter held by
the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of the
Obligations.  The Guarantor agrees that after the occurrence of

                                     -2-

<PAGE>
 
any default by FB Inc., including without limitation an Event of Default
(as such term is defined in Section 8, below), in the payment or performance
                            ---------
of the Obligations, the Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise
attempt to collect any such indebtedness of FB Inc. to the Guarantor until
the Obligations shall have been paid in full.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, the Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in
respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced
and received by the Guarantor as trustee for Outlet, and be paid over to
Outlet, on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the
liability of the Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.
In the event the Guarantor is or becomes an "insider" (as defined from time
to time in Section 101 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code) with respect to FB
Inc., any and all rights of the Guarantor (a) of reimbursement, indemnification
and exoneration against FB Inc., (b) of contribution against FB Inc. (if
the Guaranty is secured) and/or any other guarantor and (c) of subrogation
to the rights of Outlet or any similar rights under the Obligations, whether
such rights arise under an express or implied contract or operation of law,
are hereby expressly waived, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that the Guarantor shall not be deemed a "creditor" (as defined in Section
101 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code) of FB Inc. by reason of the existence
of this Guaranty, this waiver being given to induce Outlet to enter into
the Amendment.

   7.   FURTHER ASSURANCES.  The Guarantor also agrees to do all such things
and execute all such documents, including financing statements, as Outlet
may consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Guaranty
and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of Outlet hereunder.

   8.   DEFAULTS.  The occurrence of any one or more of the following events
shall constitute an "Event of Default" under the provisions of this Guaranty

of fifteen (15) days; or

       (j)  If the Guarantor fails to promptly notify Outlet, in writing,
within ten (10) days of the occurrence of any event or condition of which
the Guarantor is aware which constitutes an Event of Default, or which,
with the giving of notice or passage of time or both, would constitute an

                            STOCK PLEDGE AGREEMENT
                            ----------------------

     1.  To induce Outlet Broadcasting, Inc. (the "Secured Party"), which
term shall include its successors and assigns and the holder from time to time
of this Stock Pledge Agreement (the "Agreement"), to enter into a Time
Brokerage Agreement, dated this date, with Fant Broadcasting Company of
Ohio, Inc. ("FB Inc."), Anthony J. Fant (the "Guarantor") has delivered
a Guaranty, dated this date, to the Secured Party (the "Guaranty"). In
consideration thereof, the Guarantor does hereby grant a security interest
in, and pledge, assign, transfer and deliver to the Secured Party, and to
its successors and assigns, as general collateral security for the payment
and performance of Guarantor's obligations and liabilities under the Guaranty,
and for any and all indebtedness, obligations or liabilities of every kind
and nature of the Guarantor to the Secured Party with respect to the Guaranty,
or otherwise, or in any other manner whatsoever or any extension or renewal
thereof, (all of the foregoing hereinafter being collectively referred to
as the "Obligations"), the stock certificates attached hereto as Exhibit A
                                                                 ---------
and incorporated herein by reference, which Exhibit A has attached to it
                                            ---------
a stock power for each stock certificate, duly signed by the Guarantor as
transferor (all of the aforesaid stock certificates and powers being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Collateral").

     2.  The Guarantor warrants and represents to the Secured Party that
(i) he is the lawful owner of the Collateral free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances or other interests of third parties, (ii) he has the full
power and lawful right to pledge the Collateral to the Secured Party, (iii)
the Collateral is registered in his name on the stock transfer books and records
of FB Inc. (the "Corporation"), (iv) he will warrant and defend the title
to the Collateral against the claims and demands of any person, firm,
corporation, trust, partnership or other entity, (v) the Collateral constitutes
100% of the presently issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation, and
(vi) there are no restrictions on the transferability of the Collateral
to the Secured Party or with respect to the foreclosure and transfer thereof
by the Secured Party or, if there are any such restrictions, any and all
restrictions on the transferability have been duly waived with respect to
this assignment, transfer, pledge, and the grant of a security interest to
the Secured Party and with respect to the foreclosure and transfer thereof
by the Secured Party.

<PAGE>
 
     3.  Prior to any default in the payment or performance of the Obligations,
the Guarantor shall have all rights, powers, privileges and preferences
pertaining to the Collateral subject to the terms of this Agreement. Upon any
default in the payment or performance of the Obligations or in any of the terms
of this Agreement, the Secured Party shall have the right, at its option, to
exercise all such rights, powers, privileges and preferences pertaining to the
Collateral and to cause the Collateral to be registered in the Secured Party's
name or in the name of its nominee. To effectuate the provisions hereof, the
Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes the Secured Party as his
true and lawful attorney with full power of substitution to complete and fill in
any blank endorsements, to file the same and to take such further action as the
Secured Party may deem necessary to exercise, as a stockholder, all of his
right, title and position in the Corporation. The aforesaid power of attorney
shall be deemed irrevocable and coupled with an interest. The Guarantor further
agrees that any transfer of the Collateral under the provisions of this
paragraph shall not be deemed a sale or disposition under the provisions of
Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, nor an acceptance of such Collateral
in satisfaction of the Obligations or any portion thereof.

     4.  Upon any such default, the Secured Party shall further have all
the rights and remedies of a secured party afforded by the Uniform Commercial
Code or afforded by other applicable law. Requirement of reasonable notice with
respect to any sale or disposition shall be met if such notice is mailed,
postage prepaid, to the Guarantor at the address set forth in the Guaranty at
least five (5) days before the time of the sale or other disposition. Expenses
of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling, or the like shall include the
Secured Party's reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and legal expenses.

     5.  Until such time as the Obligations have been paid or performed
in full, the Guarantor shall not suffer or cause or permit any other or
further shares of the Corporation to be issued unless such shares are pledged
with the Secured Party as additional Collateral for the Obligations, nor
shall the Guarantor encumber the Collateral, or any part thereof, with any
lien, security interest, or encumbrance junior to the interest granted to
the Secured Party hereby, nor shall the Guarantor permit the Corporation
to be dissolved.

     6.  The Guarantor agrees that upon any assignment or transfer of the
Agreement, the Secured Party may deliver to the assignee or transferee the
Collateral, which assignee or transferee shall thereupon become vested with
all powers and rights given to the Secured Party in respect thereto and
the

                                      2
<PAGE>
 
Secured Party shall be thereafter forever relieved and fully discharged
from any liability or responsibility in connection therewith. In no event
shall the Secured Party be liable with respect to the Collateral, except
for the safekeeping thereof.

     7.  All of the agreements, obligations, undertakings, representations
and warranties herein made by the Guarantor shall inure to the benefit of
the Secured Party, its successors and assigns. The Guarantor further agrees
to execute such other instruments as the Secured Party may deem necessary
or desirable to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement, including but
not limited to UCC financing statements.

     8.  This Agreement has been executed and delivered as an Ohio agreement
and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Ohio.

     9.  The Guarantor irrevocably

         (i)   agrees that any suit, action, or other legal proceeding arising
               out of this Agreement may be brought in the courts of record
               of the State of Ohio or the courts of the United States located
               in the State of Ohio;

         (ii)  consents to the jurisdiction of such court in any such suit,
               action or proceedings; and

         (iii) waives any objection which it may have to the laying of venue
               of such suit, action or proceeding in any of such courts
               and waives any right to a trial by jury in any of such courts.

    10.  In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein should
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
or enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

    11.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including but not limited to paragraph 3, above):

         (i)   the Secured Party will not take action pursuant to this Agreement
               which would constitute or result in any assignment of license
               or change of control of FB Inc., if such assignment of license
               or change of control would require (under then-existent law)
               prior approval of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC")
               without first

                                      3
               
<PAGE>
 
          obtaining such prior approval. After a default has occurred
          and is continuing, the Debtor agrees to take any and all actions
          that the Secured Party may reasonably request in order to obtain
          any FCC approvals which are necessary or appropriate to enable
          the Secured Party to exercise and fully enjoy all rights and benefits
          granted to the Secured Party by this Agreement, including
          specifically, without limitation, the use of FB Inc.'s and
          Guarantor's reasonable efforts, at FB Inc.'s and Guarantor's cost
          and expense, to assist the Secured Party in obtaining any prior
          approvals from FCC as are necessary for performance of any action
          or transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Specifically,
          and without limitation, FB Inc. and  Guarantor will, after a
          default has occurred and is continuing, and upon the Secured Party's
          request, prepare, sign and file with the FCC all relevant portions
          of any application for assignment of license or transfer of control
          as may be necessary or appropriate under FCC rules and regulations.

     (ii) Voting rights shall remain with the Guarantor, even in the event
          of default by Guarantor. In the event of default, there shall
          be either a private or public sale of the Collateral. No sale
          of Collateral will become effective unless and until the prior
          consent thereto of the FCC has been obtained if such consent will
          then be required by the Communications Act of 1934,as amended,
          (or any successor statute) and/or the Rules, Regulations and/or
          policies of the FCC.

            OUTLET COMMUNICATIONS TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES
 
             Cranston, RI, March 21,1995-Outlet Communications, Inc.
(NASDAQ:OCOMA) announced today that its Board of Directors has retained
Goldman, Sachs & Co. as financial advisor to help the Company explore
strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a possible
business combination, the sale of all or a portion of the Company, potential
acquisitions or any other similar transactions. The Company said there can
be no assurance that any transaction will result from the exploration process.
             Headquartered in Cranston, RI, the Company owns and operates two
VHF television stations that are both NBC network affiliates: WCMH, serving
the Columbus, OH market, and WJAR-TV, serving the Providence, RI-New Bedford,
MA market. Outlet also owns a UHF station, WNCN-TV, acquired in August 1994,
which will become the NBC affiliate for the Raleigh-Durham-Goldsboro-
Fayetteville, NC market in the fall of 1995. Outlet also operates WWHO-TV,
Chillicothe, OH, under a local marketing agreement. WWHO-TV became an affiliate
of The WB Television Network in January 1995.
