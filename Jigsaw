  <h2>Make savings with your current exam board</h2>
  <p>Ask your exam board for ways you could reduce existing costs.</p>

  <p>You may be able to save money by combining costs across:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>several departments in your school</li>
    <li>all the schools in your multi-academy trust (MAT)</li>
    <li>several schools in your local authority</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p>You may be able to get a discount if you bulk buy textbooks and resources with other schools.</p>
  <p>You may be able to reduce costs if all the schools in your MAT use the same exam board.</p>
  <p>If you cannot reduce costs with your existing exam board, consider whether you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>maximise other services you pay for</li>
    <li>switch to a new exam board</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Maximise the services you already pay for</h3>
  <p>Check you’re using the resources exam boards currently offer you, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>past exam papers</li>
    <li>teaching schemes</li>
    <li>downloadable resources</li>
    <li>one-to-one advice from subject leads</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Switch to a new exam board</h2>
  <p>Use exam board switching services to help you plan your switch.</p>
  <p>A <a href="#todo">ratings grid</a> which can help you assess exam board offers is available.</p>
  <p>It may be cheaper to remain with your existing exam board.</p>
  <p>Before you switch, you should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>consider any switch fees</li>
    <li>consider additional services which you may lose</li>
    <li>assess the resources you’ll need to manage the switch</li>
    <li>assess staff training needs to meet new requirements</li>
    <li>baseline your costs by using benchmarking tools</li>
    <li>compare costs </li>
  </ul>


  <p>You can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/join-or-create-a-network-for-school-business-professionals/school-business-professional-networks-directory">schools financial benchmarking tool</a> to baseline your costs with similar schools.</p>
  <p>Guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/join-or-create-a-network-for-school-business-professionals/school-business-professional-networks-directory">finding, joining and creating school business professional networks</a> is available.</p>
  <p>The sections below give you further advice on switching exam boards.</p>


  <h3>Reduce costs</h3>
  <p>Ask your new exam board if they’ll reduce costs per entry if you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>submit entries early</li>
    <li>use the same exam board across your whole school, MAT or trust</li>
    <li>buy resources they produce</li>
    <li>buy mock exam papers in bulk instead of you photocopying them</li>
    <li>get reductions for exams produced in alternative formats such as computer-based exams</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Calculate additional costs</h3>
  <p>Ensure you know what the new exam board will charge for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>reviews of marking</li>
    <li>moderation</li>
    <li><a href="#late-fees">late fees</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Know what support you’ll get</h3>
  <p>Ensure you know if the new exam board will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>provide resources to support teachers</li>
    <li>charge extra for online resources</li>
    <li>offer free support services by phone or internet</li>
    <li>offer out of hours support</li>
    <li>give you continual advice on reducing costs</li>
    <li>offer exams in accessible formats for pupils with disabilities</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="late-fees">Avoid late fees</h2>
  <p>Late fees can double or even triple exam entry fees but planning can help you avoid them.</p>
  <p>Check exam deadlines on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your exam board’s website</li>
    <li>on the <a href="#todo">joint council for qualifications</a> website</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Change entry tiers</h3>
  <p>You should enter pupils for exams - even if you’re unsure which tier they should be entered for. You can change tiers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>at a later date</li>
    <li>free of charge if you entered the pupil before the deadline</li>
  </ul>

  <p>More information on <a href="#todo">deciding which GCSE tier to choose</a> is available on the Ofqual website.</p>

  <h3>Get support to avoid late fees</h3>
  <p>Tell the senior leadership team (SLT) how much the school spends on late fees. SLTs can help arrange the necessary support for staff so you can plan effectively.</p>

  <h3>Coordinate staff activity</h3>
  <p>SLTs may want to consider not having any all-school events in the week of the entry deadline to help free up staff time.</p>
  <p>Appoint an exams officer</p>
  <p>SLTs may want to appoint an exams officer. The exams officer’s role is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>submit exam entry data to each relevant exam board</li>
    <li>arrange the practicalities of exams, such as invigilators and timetabling</li>
    <li>support an exams strategy for the school or trust</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Appealing exam results</h2>
  <p>Exam boards must now offer access to AS and A level exam scripts.</p>
  <p>Exam boards must offer access to GCSE exam scripts by summer 2020. Some exam boards are already offering this service.</p>
  <p>It’s often cheaper to ask for students’ exam scripts rather than appealing decisions directly with the exam board. To do this, you can:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ask for the student’s exam script, which is either free or costs about £12.</li>
    <li>Use the mark scheme to review the student’s script which exam boards must provide schools on request.</li>
    <li>Decide whether you want to proceed to a formal appeal which costs around £36 to £58 depending on the qualification.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Ask for marked AS or A level papers</h3>
  <p>You can also ask exam boards for marked AS and A level papers. </p>
  <p>You can then review how the papers have been marked to help you decide whether you want to proceed to a formal appeal.</p>

  <h3>When you will not be charged</h3>
  <p>You will not be charged for appeals if your exam board has found a reason to change grades.</p>
